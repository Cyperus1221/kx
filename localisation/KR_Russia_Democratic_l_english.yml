rusdeminfo.10.t:0 "RSDRP: 1917-1923"
rusdeminfo.10.d:0 "During the elections to the Constituent Assembly, the Mensheviks took second place. Having become the main party fighting for the rights of the proletariat in the absence of the Bolsheviks, the Mensheviks under the leadership of Yuliy Martov became a major proletarian party. However, in view of the key differences between Martov and Kerensky, the latter preferred a coalition with the Kadets, confirming Milyukov as prime minister. The Mensheviks, however, continued to cooperate with the government and were not in the full sense an opposition party, since Kerensky understood the importance of the workers' question and approved many Menshevik reforms.\n\nEven in the first years of republican rule, the split in the Menshevik party was obvious. On the one hand, there was a large faction of internationalists led by Martov, who had the greatest popularity. The victory of the proletarian revolution in France greatly strengthened their position. They were joined by a more radical group of internationalists, who had previously collaborated with the Bolsheviks, led by Lozovskiy. Having previously created a separate party, by 1920 this group had merged back into the Mensheviks. On the other side was a group of right-wing Mensheviks, headed by Askelrod. Their program did not presuppose an alliance with the communards, but a bet on the bourgeoisie and reform. However, Martov, who fell ill with tuberculosis in 1920, gradually withdrew from the leadership of the party, and his place as leader was taken by Rafail Abramovich, Deputy Chairman of the Central Committee of the RSDLP, a member of the Bund."

rusdeminfo.11.t:0 "RSDRP: 1923-1928"
rusdeminfo.11.d:0 "In 1923, Martov died of tuberculosis, in connection with which a New congress of the RSDRP was convened, which was once again won by the Internationalists, who were now led by Abramovich. During this period, a Bloc of New Bolsheviks, led by Bukharin and Rykov, also emerged, who managed to win over a part of the peasantry and the proletariat. However, the position of the Mensheviks was strengthened during the successful British Revolution of 1925, and the party leadership participated in the creation of the Third Internationale. This activity alarmed the more moderate Mensheviks, who still remembered Bolshevism perfectly well and were inclined to cooperate with the liberal parties and Socialists-Revolutionaries. Open cooperation with the Communards complicated the relations of the Mensheviks with the ruling parties, and the rhetoric of the Mensheviks gradually changed in the direction of sharply criticizing Kerensky and the Kadets.\n\nThe reform of the Senate in 1925, the radicalization of society and the emergence of the NRPR strengthened the position of Askelrod and the right-wing Mensheviks, who believed that the weakening of the Kerensky regime would only lead to the strengthening of the radicals and the fall of democracy. In 1927, the right-wing Mensheviks seized the initiative and began to dominate the Central Committee, and after the elections to the Duma, Askelrod was elected the new chairman of the party.\n\nAskelrod did much to rally the party and by the time of his death in 1928, the party was once again united and internal party differences were no longer so strong. The new leader of the party was Potresov, one of the founders of the party and a supporter of reformism."
rusdeminfo.11.a:0 "Next"

rusdeminfo.12.t:0 "RSDRP: 1928-1936"
rusdeminfo.12.d:0 "Potresov, as the head of the party, established contacts with the Socialists-Revolutionaries and Kadets and became their close ally. Under his auspices, the party became a key agitator of workers' rights, and many Mensheviks were appointed to key positions, and most of the trade unions, including the VTsSPS, the organisation of Russian Trade Unions, became controlled by the Mensheviks.\nDespite his distrust of Bukharin, Potresov, like the rest of the leaders of the socialist parties, generally considers the creation of a homogeneous socialist government in an emergency, although this will not be an easy decision for the party."
rusdeminfo.12.a:0 "Cool"

rusdeminfo.13.t:0 "PSR: 1920-1927"
rusdeminfo.13.d:0 "The Socialist-Revolutionary Party has been the ruling party for the past 15 years. Nevertheless, most of the party's program was considered too radical by President Kerensky, who continued to remain a nominal member of the Socialist-Revolutionary Party.\nAt the same time, the leader of the PSR, Viktor Chernov, remained in the shadows most of the time, being the speaker of the State Council until 1925, when it was transformed into the Senate, and then the speaker of the Duma until 1927, when he became a minister without portfolio. Chernov considered Kerensky only as an opportunity to promote Socialist-Revolutionary reforms and was always more inclined to ally with the Mensheviks than with the Kadets.\n\nDuring the first term of the SR-Kadet coalition and President Kerensky, the Social Revolutionaries lobbied in every possible way for a land reform that could solve the peasant question once and for all. However, the adoption of the law on the socialization of land was postponed in every possible way as well and in the end was only half adopted, leaving land in large cities and nearby provinces under private control. The unfinished land reform became a stumbling block in the relations between Chernov's centrist SRs and Kerensky's right SRS, hindered the stability of the government and reduced the popularity of the SRS and the president among the population. As a result of the unsuccessful reform, the dissatisfaction with the leadership of the party led to the emergence of new internal party factions: the center-left Volsky and Gerstein, who called themselves MPSR (The Minority of the PSR), whose positions were very close to the Left SR, but still rejected revolutionary socialism; and Savinkov, who managed to establish an entire right-wing party of ex-members of SRs, whose ideological position was further to the right."

rusdeminfo.14.t:0 "PSR: 1927-1936"
rusdeminfo.14.d:0 "The second term of the SR-Kadet coalition passed the same way as the first, but it was overshadowed by the strengthening of the power of the Senate, the economic crisis and German control. Kerensky's cooperation with the Senate and the Germans contributed to the deterioration of the popularity of the Socialist-Revolutionaries, as well as the final break between Kerensky and Chernov.\n\nThe elections of 1932, both presidential and parliamentary, marked the beginning of the end of the long rule of the SR-Kadet coalition and Kerensky. The Socialist-Revolutionaries lost the Duma elections of 1932, losing the majority to the NRPR, and only an electoral and parliamentary coalition with the Kadets saved them from a final loss. Starting in 1932, the legislation against opposition parties and assemblies was sharply tightened, largely due to Kerensky's fears about the activities of Savinkov and the NPRP, and by the beginning of 1936, attempts were made on many high-ranking officials, including Kerensky himself. Despite all of the above, there are still those in the Socialist-Revolutionary party who see the future of the party in cooperation with the Kadets, as well as those who are more inclined towards Savinkov."

rusdeminfo.15.t:0 "KDP: 1920-1925"
rusdeminfo.15.d:0 "The Party of Constitutional Democrats (Kadets), whose main electorate was liberal-minded landowners, industrialists, merchants, bankers, teachers, doctors, employees and intellectuals, took third place during the elections to the Constituent Assembly, thus becoming the only major non-socialist party. Already since 1920, the Kadet party has united various factions, which can be divided into Milyukov's centrist Kadets, Nekrasov's left Kadets, Progressives who joined the party, Nabokov's right Kadets, as well as individuals who supported Kolchak and were in his government. In addition, the party was conditionally divided into supporters of the republic and the monarchy.\n\nAfter the Constituent Assembly and the restoration of the republic, a number of programmatic and tactical issues somewhat diverted the various currents in the party from each other. In the end, the victory was won by the centrists of Milyukov, who was elected Prime-Minister in the Kerensky government.\n\nIn 1925, during the Kolchak putsch, many cadets, especially regional officials, went over to his side, and as a result founded their own party, known as the "Kadets of the Far-East", and in the Russian Republic the SR-Kadet coalition consolidated its power, which was destined to last for another 10 years."

rusdeminfo.16.t:0 "KDP: 1925-1936"
rusdeminfo.16.d:0 "By 1936, the situation of the cadets was not the best. The obvious failure of the SR-Kadet coalition and Kerensky, the unsuccessful reforms and the growing popularity of radical parties raises the question of the complete disappearance of the party. In addition to external threats, there are also internal ones. Pavel Milyukov refuses to nominate his candidacy for the post of Prime-Minister, and more and more the initiative in the left wing goes to Nikolay Nekrasov, who supports the resumption of the coalition with the revolutionary democrats (Socialist-Revolutionaries and Mensheviks), as well as strengthening the power of the Duma.\n\nOn the other hand, the power in the right wing belongs to the elderly Vladimir Nabokov, who still supports the restoration of the monarchy and an alliance with the conservatives. But if he fails in his endeavors, it is quite likely that Alexander Konovalov, who stands for a strong presidential power and tries to unite former Progressives into a new party of the bourgeoisie and entrepreneurs, will occupy the power vacuum."

rusdeminfo.17.t:0 "VNS: 1921-1925"
rusdeminfo.17.d:0 "The history of the All-Russian National Union began long before 1921, when in 1908 such a party was first created and united moderate-right politicians. Russian Russians who "belong to the indigenous Russian population or have organically merged with the Russian people"could become members of the VNS. Soon Vasily Shulgin, a well-known Russian nationalist, but of a progressive persuasion, joined the Union, who actually became the main speaker of the party and will still play a significant role in it.\n\nAfter the February Revolution, like other right-wing and monarchist parties, the VNS was banned, and was revived by the forces of Shulgin and Dmitry Romanov shortly after the second Constituent Assembly and the proclamation of Russia as a democratic federal republic. Having united all the right-wing, conservative and monarchist parties, the VNS soon became the main stronghold of the right in the new Russia.\n\nNot enjoying popularity among the general population, the main electorate of the VNS was mainly representatives of large capital, monarchical circles and conservative intellectuals. The number of seats in the Duma of the VNS has never exceeded 30 people. Everything changed in 1925, when Kerensky reformed the State Council and changed the electoral quotas, which allowed the Conservatives to gain a majority in the upper house of parliament by 1934. Dmitry Romanov became the Speaker of the Senate, and the Senate itself regularly re-elected Kerensky for a new term."

rusdeminfo.18.t:0 "VNS: 1925-1936"
rusdeminfo.18.d:0 "In the hope of reducing dependence on German capital, it was the senators-members of the VNS who proposed to Kerensky to begin a policy of protectionism aimed at developing domestic production. The state reduced trade with Germany, which in the short term led to a rapid growth of industry, but soon turned into a failure due to a reduction in important supplies of German equipment. This policy eventually led to the closure of most German enterprises and increased unemployment.\n\nHowever, nevertheless, the conservatives retained power in the Senate, and, moreover, they did not abandon the policy of protectionism, making it their central core of the economic program. Despite the seemingly unbreakable unity of the party, like other political parties, it is fragmented.\n\nThe two leading players in the VNS are Vasily Shulgin and Dmitry Romanov. The first, the formal leader of the party, advocates the restoration of the monarchy in a constitutional or semi-constitutional style, trying to achieve a referendum and nominate his candidate, who does not necessarily turn out to be from the Romanov dynasty.\nThe second, the speaker of the Senate and the acting acting president, rather has more selfish goals in strengthening his personal power, whether it is monarchical in connection with his quite legitimate claims to the throne, or republican as the head of an authoritarian aristocratic republic.\n\nHowever, there is also a third player in the VNS, Felix Yusupov, a close associate of Romanov, who sees the future of the country not in the expansion of the power of the aristocracy, but rather of the oligarchy and big capital - after all, having such associates, many roads will open up for Yusupov."

In this case, until July 1936, when the Senate must elect a new president of Russia by a simple majority.\n\nDespite the authoritarianism of this approach, it is there, and Dmitry Pavlovich Romanov, the current Speaker of the Senate, will hold the position of acting president until the next election.\n\nWhile Dmitry Romanov is in power, he can do a lot to strengthen his power, even though he has no real power, he is supported by the Senate. The situation is compounded by the fact that no party that can win the snap elections will be able to gain a majority in the authoritarian Senate, which is very likely to want to elect Dmitry Romanov as the legitimate president.\n\nIf this happens, we will find ourselves in a situation that Kerensky did not anticipate: the risk of strengthening the power of the Senate and the President, and a sharp reduction in the power of the Duma.

Hoping to break from obscurity as quickly as possible, Savinkov and the NRPR took loan after loan to fund their political campaigns, and they hoped that they would be able to write off all of their debts upon coming to power. This has not happened and the movement has found itself severely indebted, with no way to pay off their staff or workers, and popular support for them waning because of ongoing economic stabilisation.\n\nSavinkov was forced to lay off campaigners, disband many of the party's branches, and significantly cut the size of the Combat Squads. His movement has started to splinter, the left wing has broken off and its leaders began blasting Savinkov in national newspapers, accusing him of running the NRPR as a clique of yesmen... all in all, it has not been a good year for them. Popular support for the NRPR has decayed, their rallies have ceased, and their deputies in the Duma have chosen to ally with the SRs and Eurasianists.\n\nIt appears that Savinkov's hopes of taking power in Russia have been dashed for good."

rusdem.300.d:0 "No matter how it might seem from the side of the beautiful idyll of the two socialist parties - the Left SRs, led by Spiridonova, and the People's Socialists, led by Bukharin, their coalition turned out to be nothing more than a conspiracy for the sake of passing the barrier to the Duma. Despite the fact that the parties have formed a government coalition, there is still much to change in the country.\nIn the conditions of a minority and partly hostile Senate, as well as an absolute lack of confidence on the part of the army, the coalition has huge plans.\n\nThe Prime Minister and the government of the country, of course, are forced to cooperate with the coalition party, but every day the connection between them weakens. In the near future, the government will organize an official meeting with representatives of the trade union movement. The All-Russian Conference of Trade Unions will also be attended by ministers, as well as prominent members of both parties. The media already call the congress unprecedented and decisive for the fate of many citizens, especially workers."
rusdem.300.a:0 "May unity be more important than politics?"

rusdem.301.t:0 "The Beginning of the Trade Unions Conference"
rusdem.301.d:0 "Today, an All-Russian Conference of Trade Unions is scheduled to take place in Moscow, with the participation of the government and the leadership of the PLSR and NSP parties. According to eyewitnesses, many have already arrived at the congress, including the leaders of the parties, Nikolay Bukharin and Maria Spiridonova.\n\nThe key issues that will be raised at the congress are, of course, about the future of trade unions in Russia. At the moment, most of the trade unions are controlled by the Mensheviks, many of the state trade unions are united in the VTsSPS - formally a state association.\n\nThe positions of the NSP and the PLSR on the issue of the work of trade unions remain controversial and hinder the normal functioning of the coalition. Bukharin's position is that reconciliation is necessary on this issue. All trade unions should be nationalized, that is, become state-owned and their activities should be subordinate to the state. This approach is criticized by other members of the NSP, the so-called Trade-Unionist faction, headed by Tomsky. He proposes the syndicalization of trade unions, namely, their control over economic activity, as well as their existence as separate independent cells of workers' self-government. This approach is also shared by the Party of Left Socialists-Revolutionaries, but in the other way. They believe that the national economy should be managed by economic Soviets, created by elected representatives of unions of self-governing enterprises and cooperative unions."

As the head of the All-Russian Union of Trade Unions since 1922 and the general secretary of the Profintern since 1921, Lozovsky is one of the key figures in the left wing of the RSDRP and in the Russian trade union movement. Although he left his position in the VTsSPS for the presidency, he felt it necessary to express his point of view.\n\nLozovsky called for leaving the trade unions alone. He said that the existing system is quite effective, as it allows workers to organize themselves, and the state to have large trade union associations under its control. Losing the status-quo, and, therefore, this balance, will lead to drastic consequences for the proletariat. Nevertheless, he pointed out that he will not veto the Bill."

At the initiative of the party leaders, two future draft laws were put forward for a general vote of the conference participants.\n\nThe first, which is part of the official program of the left Socialists-Revolutionaries, implied the transfer of economic power in the country to the federation of syndicates, which will soon be formed.\nThe second, Bukharin's project, implied the control of trade unions and their nationalization, which some critics regarded as a betrayal of the working class and the transfer of the powers of the elected trade unions into the hands of the state, which so far is neither Workers' Pepublic nor Soviet Democracy."

The harsh civil war, which claimed millions of lives, as well as the lives of their former comrades, seriously affected the formation of the Russian Army in the post-war years. With some exceptions, most of the generals are quite conservative, and many officers are not ready to fight for socialist ideas. We will have to solve this problem, perhaps by dismissing a couple of high-ranking officers who refuse to fight for our legally elected government."

rusdem.306.d:0 "Speaking in Parliament today, Prime Minister Bukharin harshly went through the current political system, paying special attention to the fact that as a result of Kerensky's actions for his own enrichment, the country was on the verge of economic collapse and famine. There is poverty everywhere, and the peasants are suffering because of the unsuccessful land reform.\n\nIn his address, Bukharin also highlighted the importance of adopting his New Economic Program, which will put the country on its feet and lead to an improvement in the situation in the national economy."
rusdem.306.a:0 "We need to take measures."

rusdem.307.t:0 "NEP Bill Passed!"
rusdem.307.d:0 "Thanks to the efforts of Bukharin and the NSP party in convincing the majority of State Duma members of the need for the speedy adoption of a law on a New Economic Policy, they managed to achieve success. It has been two days since the law on the NEP came into force, which means that the Ministry of Economy and Finance now has a free hand in managing the future national economy."
rusdem.307.a:0 "Great!"

rusdem.308.t:0 "NEP Bill Strangled!"
rusdem.308.d:0 "The opposition parties in the State Duma rejected our bill on a New Economic Policy! These bourgeois capitalists, who occupied half of the seats in parliament, seem to imagine themselves the arbiters of the destinies of millions of ordinary peasants! Due to our control over the government, we can bypass the State Duma and start introducing the NEP as part of the new financial and economic policy of the government, and no duma can prevent us from doing this."
rusdem.308.a:0 "Go on with NEP!"

rusdem.309.t:0 "Start of the NEP"
rusdem.309.d:0 "The Government headed by Prime Minister Bukharin has launched an economic reform to transform into a planned economy. So far, private property remains in our country, and it will be very difficult to nationalize it. According to Bukharin's plan, it will be necessary to abolish private property in large cities, as well as to complete Kerensky's unfinished land reform. It is proposed to finally socialize the socialized land in the hands of local peasant councils, but at the same time allow the peasants to earn on their own harvest. Thus, the peasants will have an incentive to work, and the pace of agricultural development will increase significantly.\n\nThe situation is different in the city, where private property is planned to be completely abolished and all factories to be nationalized. Such a doctrine within the framework of the NEP was called "Socialism - in the city, Capitalism - in the village". This will allow cities to develop under the control of the state and industrialize, and agriculture to develop and feed the multi-million population of the country. In addition, the government plans to prohibit foreign companies from owning property on the territory of Russia, with the exception of some concessions."
rusdem.309.a:0 "Time to implement the NEP!"

rusdem.310.t:0 "Confiscation of Private Property"
rusdem.310.d:0 "Today will be remembered by many capitalists for a long time, because in large Russian cities, the most important strategic factories that were still in private hands were nationalized. One of these organizations was the famous Society of Putilov Factories. Already once nationalized by the Bolsheviks in 1918, and then returned by Kerensky, the Society of Putilov Factories was again nationalized, and again by the Bolsheviks, although already former.\n\nIn addition to the Society of Putilov Factories, many other enterprises were nationalized, including foreign ones associated with Putilov, which he undoubtedly perceived as attacks on himself personally. Putilov made a public speech in the Duma, where he condemned the actions of the government, but received only ridicule from the socialist majority in parliament. Putilov said that he intends to appeal to the Supreme Court and return the lost property.\n\nMany other rich owners have also stated similar problems, however, they must respect the people who elected the NSP, and they have no choice but to admit that their personal losses are for the benefit of the whole of Russia."
rusdem.310.a:0 "They should stop robbing the common people!"

rusdem.311.t:0 "Unrest in Major Cities"
rusdem.311.d:0 "In the major cities of Russia, there are small protest movements of capitalists, but especially of the middle class of small bourgeois and philistines, who also lost some property. They demand compensation from the state for the nationalization of their property. The government can make concessions to them and allocate compensation funds, but in this way we will lose points in the eyes of ordinary workers and peasants, as well as other socialist parties. At the same time, if we do not do this, we will suffer for some time from outraged capitalists."
rusdem.311.a:0 "Appease them for now."
rusdem.311.b:0 "Ignore the protests."

rusdem.312.t:0 "The Importance of 'Smychka'"
rusdem.312.d:0 "Despite the fact that our state cannot yet be called a full-fledged workers 'and peasants' state, the importance of uniting the two revolutionary classes is very necessary. The fact is that the workers do not get along very well with the peasants, whom they perceive as kulaks and bourgeois who can earn much more by their labor than they do. Despite the fact that we have raised wages and reduced the hours of workers, there is still a high level of urban unemployment.\n\nPrime Minister Bukharin stated:\n'The essence of the New Economic Policy is the union of the Proletariat and the Peasantry, the essence is in the smychka (link) of Vanguard Proletariat with a Wide Peasant Field.'"
rusdem.312.a:0 "Long live Smychka of City and Village!"

rusdem.313.t:0 "Subsidies to Peasants"
rusdem.313.d:0 "To stimulate agriculture, it is necessary to allocate subsidies to newly minted farmers for the purchase of the latest agricultural equipment and the gradual mechanization of agriculture. This will give the peasants an incentive to cultivate Russian fields, and the money received from taxes will go to the industrialization of cities.\n\nDespite the fact that our partners in the socialist bloc in the Duma strongly opposed subsidizing wealthy peasants, and some deputies even accused us of developing capitalist relations in the countryside, the government is convinced that these measures are necessary."
rusdem.313.a:0 "We will receive this money back in taxes."

rusdem.314.t:0 "On the Issue of Private Entrepreneurship"
rusdem.314.d:0 "The situation in the city has raised an open question about the future of small business owners. On the one hand, along with the nationalization of many enterprises and an almost complete ban on private entrepreneurship, there is still a sector of goods and services that are not particularly important for the economy in private hands. Prime Minister Bukharin said that for a smoother transition to the socialist economy, these sectors will remain private. Thus, capitalist relations will remain in the city, but at a small level. In addition, as the Prime Minister stated, how does a small-scale farmer or merchant differ from a worker and a peasant?"
rusdem.314.a:0 "We hope they will calm down for now."

rusdem.315.t:0 "The Invention of A New Name"
rusdem.315.d:0 "In view of the growing popularization of the idea of linking the city and the village, a list of names for newborns appeared in the official newspaper of the NSP. One of these names was the female name "Dazdrasmygda", constructed from the phrase "Long live the Smychka of the city with the village". According to some reports, the name is gradually taking root, and this month parents gave this name to their newborn girls in 5 cases out of 100."
rusdem.315.a:0 "Smychka to the masses!"

rusdem.316.t:0 "Our Companies Nationalized in Russia!"
rusdem.316.d:0 "With the coming to power of the Socialist Party in Russia, they decided to nationalize all enterprises in key industries. With the closure of our companies in Russia, we may face certain losses that need to be made up. We can appeal to the Russian government and demand payments and compensation for the nationalization of our enterprises, or declare a boycott and stop all trade."
rusdem.316.a:0 "Try to negotiate with them for payments."

rusdem.317.t:0 "[FROM.GetName] Demands Compensation!"
rusdem.317.d:0 "After we have nationalized some of the [FROM.GetAdjective] companies they demanded that we should compensate them for their loss. While they are definetely intervening in our internal affairs, we probably can't afford paying all of them. How shall we answer?"
rusdem.317.a:0 "Who they think they are?"
rusdem.317.b:0 "Perhaps, we should pay..."

rusdem.318.t:0 "Payments From Russia"
rusdem.318.d:0 "The Russian government has agreed to compensate us for nationalizing our companies. This means that we can maintain good trade relations with Russia."
rusdem.318.a:0 "Great!"

rusdem.319.t:0 "Russia Refused to Pay!"
rusdem.319.d:0 "The Russian government has refused to pay us for nationalizing our companies. This means that we cannot reach agreements with the new government and it seems that the only way is to embargo and boycott them."
rusdem.319.a:0 "They will pay for them, eventually."

rusdem.320.t:0 "[FROM.GetName] Cut Ties With Us!"
rusdem.320.d:0 "Due to the nationalization of [FROM.GetAdjective] companies, they decided to embargo us and cut all diplomatic relations with us!"
rusdem.320.a:0 "Not our problems, obviously."

rusdem.321.t:0 "Open Concessions in [FROM.GetName]?"
rusdem.321.d:0 "The government of [FROM.GetName] has offered us to sign a trade treaty. Due to the fact that they have nationalized some of the foreign companies, they seem to be in a desire need for debts from our banks. On the one hand, if we want to invest in their country, it can help our economy by receiving some profit, but on the other hand, it will boost their economy as well."
rusdem.321.a:0 "Reject their initiatives."
rusdem.321.b:0 "Sure, why not?"

rusdem.322.t:0 "[FROM.GetName] Agreed!"
rusdem.322.d:0 "The [FROM.GetAdjective] government has agreed to sign the trade treaty with us, bringing their concessions into our core land."

rusdem.324.d:0 "The current contract on foreign concessions with Russia has expired, but we can try to extend it for a new period."
rusdem.324.b:0 "Let's do this"
rusdem.324.a:0 "Why should we do this?"

rusdem.325.t:0 "[FROM.GetName] Asks For Prolonging Their Concession"

rusdem.325.b:0 "We had enough from them!"

rusdem.326.t:0 "[FROM.GetName] Stops Their Concession"

rusdem.327.d:0 "As the current contract on [FROM.GetAdjective] concession has expired, their government has decided to close our concession, no matter what."
rusdem.327.a:0 "Poor news."

rusdem.328.t:0 "The Last Foreign Concession Closed"
rusdem.328.d:0 "The happy days of foreign concessions are over. Foreign powers either refuse to invest in us and resources, or we have closed their concessions ourselves. It seems that now we will have to rely only on ourselves."
rusdem.328.a:0 "The end of Foreign Capital."

rusdem.329.t:0 "Mutiny in the Land Forces"
rusdem.329.d:0 "Since the end of the civil War, there have been serious contradictions between the Russian Army, including many officers, and first of all, generals, and politicians of the socialist mindset. Well remembering the horrors of the Civil War, the generals are very wary of the socialists, but during the reign of Kerensky, a certain consensus was reached that allowed the Russian army to develop at least.\n\nHowever, now that outright socialists are in power, riots and a boycott have begun in the army, affecting the entire combat capability of the Russian ground troops. On the part of the generals, refusal to carry out orders has become commonplace, and on the part of the officers, mass desertion and dismissal have been noticed.\n\nThus, we need to solve this urgent problem and restore order in the troops, because Russia is surrounded by enemies and their puppets. If we do not manage to restore order in the army in time, we may face armed resistance 'for the sake of preserving the democracy'."
rusdem.329.a:0 "It's time to act."

rusdem.330.t:0 "Dealing With Generals"
rusdem.330.d:0 "One of the main problems in the army is its leadership. It is high time for General Kornilov, the permanent head of the armed forces since 1920... retire. Despite the fact that he is not a monarchist and advocated a Republican system, his authoritarian tendencies and the presence of influence that allows him to seize power in the country are very annoying for the current leadership. By removing the head of the army and appointing a new commander-in-chief, we will be able to avoid problems in the future.\n\nHowever, this is not all. The head of the General Staff, Anton Denikin, although he stands for democracy and is not against the republic, popularly called the "Peasant Marshal", can also be dangerous, and probably should be replaced by a more "friendly" candidate.\n\nPyotr Wrangel, the "Black Baron", an ardent opponent of socialism and an inveterate monarchist, closes the problematic trinity. Although he does not formally hold any government posts, he is the vice-president of Kornilov in the ROVS, and has a huge influence, probably more than the two above-mentioned personalities.\n\nWe need to decide their fate in the near future, thus easing our situation."
rusdem.330.a:0 "We should decide their fate."

### Events possibly leading to RCW ###
rcw.1.t:0 "Goodbye, Old Lavr"
rcw.1.d:0 "Today, by presidential decree, the supreme commander of the Russian army, an outstanding figure of the white movement, Lavr Kornilov, was dismissed.\n\nInstead of him, a fairly young but promising brigade commander Rodion Malinovsky was appointed to the post of Supreme commander-in-chief. His appointment caused a flurry of criticism of the government, but having a like-minded person at the head of the Army only strengthened him. Soon Malinovsky appealed to the President with a demand to begin the speedy reform of the Army.\n\nAt the same time, Kornilov reacted quite sharply to his resignation and reacted even more sharply to the appointment of Malinovsky, saying that the boy hardly held a real weapon in his hands. Fearing Kornilov's uprising, we can quietly remove him... or leave it alone. Perhaps a compromise option would be to settle him in a state dacha and give certain guarantees, but it is unlikely that Kornilov will silently agree to this..."
rcw.1.a:0 "Let the Cheka remove him silently..."
rcw.1.b:0 "Try to remove him silently..."
rcw.1.c:0 "Offer him guarantees and well-deserved rest."
rcw.1.e:0 "Ignore him."

rcw.2.t:0 "Sudden Death of General Kornilov"
rcw.2.d:0 "Suddenly, news came about the sudden death of Genaral Kornilov, which immediately attracted media attention due to his recent resignation and the appointment of the pro-government head of the Army. As reported, General Kornilov died as a result of a massive heart attack, in his home, late at night. However, according to eyewitnesses, there was a fuss in the apartment, and a black car of the Nizhny Novgorod plant was standing under the windows.\n\nThe very next day after the news, a fairly large rally gathered in Moscow demanding an investigation into the General's death, and many prominent officers made the same demands. On the one hand, we can officially recognize the death as natural, but we will lose the support of people and only raise even greater doubts. On the other hand, we can falsify the investigation and come to the same result, which will satisfy the needs of the protesters."
rcw.2.a:0 "Well, he was rather old..."
rcw.2.b:0 "Investigation Will Be Held"

rcw.3.t:0 "Kornilov's Death"
rcw.3.d:0 "Lavr Georgiyevich Kornilov, Supreme Commander-in-chief, one of the four officers that led the White Movement against the Bolsheviks during the civil war, passed away last night at his dacha outside Petrograd at the age of 68.  Kornilov has greatly contributed to post-revolutionary Russia's politics. Two weeks of national mourning have been declared as the people prepare for the funeral ceremony."
rcw.3.a:0 "The great helmsman of the Russian nation is no more." 

rcw.4.t:0 "Kornilov Raises An Uprising"
rcw.4.d:0 "Ignoring Kornilov, we were faced with the fact that he managed to get out of the capital and go to the South of Russia, where he began to convene a rather conservative electorate to defend the Motherland from the socialists. Thus, creating essentially a second Volunteer army. He was joined in the majority by other generals who declared loyalty to the former regime and the impossibility of serving the socialist minority. It seems that the situation is heating up and we need to take urgent measures..."
rcw.4.a:0 "That's enough. The government retires."
rcw.4.b:0 "Call for the loyal forces and demand Kornilov's surrender."
rcw.4.c:0 "We shall act more decisively. Proclaim the RSR!"

rcw.5.t:0 "New Elections"
rcw.5.d:0 "The government decided to resign, having lost most of the popular support and now humiliated and almost destroyed. The next election will be held in two months. Critics will say that the ruling party betrayed the masses, but, as the party leaders say, this was done in the name of national stability and in order to avoid war. The generals returned to Headquarters, disbanding the volunteer army.
rcw.5.a:0 "Victory or Loss? That is the question."

rcw.6.t:0 "Kornilov Ignores the Ultimatum!"
rcw.6.d:0 "General Kornilov has ignored the ultimatum we sent and escaped to Volgograd, where he started to build up defences and call for the Second Volunteer Army to fight against us. Well, he made his choice, now he will regret it."
rcw.6.a:0 "Onwards!"
rcw.6.b:0 "Fight for Holy Russia! (Play as Volunteer Army)"

rcw.7.t:0 "The Proclamation of Russian Socialist Republic"
rcw.7.d:0 "The Old Republic is gone. Now only the socialists will decide fate of proletarian masses. The wild Generals, led by Kornilov have decided to play their own game, let us see how they will react now."
rcw.7.a:0 "Onwards!"
rcw.7.b:0 "Fight for Holy Russia! (Play as Volunteer Army)"

rcw.8.t:0 "Test the Peasant Marshal"
rcw.8.d:0 "Anton Denikin, nicknamed the Peasant Marshal, actually has nothing in common with the peasants and the proletariat. He conducted one of the most successful campaigns against the Reds during the Civil War, so he definitely should not be trusted. At the same time, his authority is quite high, and perhaps keeping him as head of the General Staff at least for the moment will help us gain time and calm the situation in the army."
rcw.8.a:0 "Let the Cheka remove him silently..."
rcw.8.b:0 "Try to remove him silently..."
rcw.8.c:0 "Leave him be for now."
rcw.8.e:0 "Have him retire."

rcw.9.t:0 "Anton Denikin Dies"
rcw.9.d:0 "A Hero of the Civil War and the informal leader of Russian conservatives, Anton Ivanovich Denikin, died yesterday in his manor. Although never as radical as his counterpart, Baron Wrangel, Denikin's influence throughout Russia was hard to overestimate. A week of national mourning has been declared as the people bade farewell to one of the few true Heroes of Russia."
rcw.9.a:0 "Even the strongest die one day!"

rcw.10.t:0 "Sudden Death of General Denikin"
rcw.10.d:0 "Today, our country has received the terrible news about the sudden death of one of the best sons of the Fatherland, General Denikin. With the coming to power of the Socialist Party, relations between Denikin, as well as other conservative generals, and the government deteriorated significantly. Denikin's sudden death aroused suspicions even among some supporters of the current government, let alone the opposition-minded electorate. Baron Wrangel, one of the closest associates of Kornilov and Denikin, claimed that the murder was covered up by the government and demanded that the government immediately resign and transfer power into the hands of the provisional government, which he will lead."
rcw.10.a:0 "Give in his demands."
rcw.10.b:0 "Who he is to dictate us?"

rcw.11.t:0 "Wrangel Raises An Uprising"
rcw.11.d:0 "Baron Wrangel went to Volgograd, where he was able to raise the conservative-minded population and some generals to declare the creation of a Government of National Salvation. Having accused the current government of dealing with Denikin, he is serious and we need to fight back against him."
rcw.11.a:0 "Onwards!"
rcw.11.b:0 "Fight for Holy Russia! (Play as Government of National Salvation)"

rcw.12.t:0 "Provisional Military Government"
rcw.12.d:0 "The socialist government was humiliated and agreed to transfer power into the hands of a strong leader, Baron Wrangel. Having headed the provisional government, Wrangel can be sure that now any decision depends on his will."
rcw.12.a:0 "Call for elections in two months."
rcw.12.b:0 "Restore the Romanovs."
rcw.12.c:0 "Found a new royal dynasty."

rcw.13.t:0 "The Retirement of Denikin"
rcw.13.d:0 "Today, the head of the General Staff, Anton Denikin, was dismissed, and a promising pro-socialist general, Alexander Vasilevsky, took his chair. His views have long been the subject of rumors, but now they have been confirmed. Vasilevsky is respected among the generals, and therefore Denikin's resignation was not taken so seriously. Nevertheless, the former head of the General Staff himself announced an attempt to seize power, and no matter how paradoxical it may sound, he said that he intends to lead a popular uprising against the government. His statements violate the laws of our country and we should have arrested him to avoid trouble."
rcw.13.a:0 "Immediately arrest him!"
rcw.13.b:0 "Ignore him."
rcw.13.c:0 "Cheka will deal with him."

rcw.14.t:0 "Denikin Raises An Uprising"
rcw.14.d:0 "Anton Denikin went to Volgograd, where he was able to raise the conservative-minded poulation and some generals to declare the creation of the Second Armed Forces of South Russia. Having accused the current government of trying to establish socialism across Russia, he is serious and we need to fight back against him."
rcw.14.a:0 "Ownards!"
rcw.14.b:0 "Fight for Holy Russia! (Play as South Russia)"

rcw.15.t:0 "White Army. Black Baron"
rcw.15.d:0 "Although formally Baron Wrangel did not hold public posts, he was the vice-president of the ROVS under Kornilov, and after his departure became the head. His activities can be dangerous, and therefore the government proposes to send him to retirement and dissolve the ROVS, as a prohibited military organization, unnecessary in peacetime. A less popular solution would be to leave everything as it is, assuming that there is no threat from Wrangel."
rcw.15.a:0 "Dismantle the ROVS."
rcw.15.b:0 "Ignore him."

rcw.16.t:0 "Calming Down the Army"
rcw.16.d:0 "Now that all the main opponents among the general staff have been eliminated, it seems that we have managed to solve one of the main problems. At the same time, many officers are still rebelling, and we should solve this problem. The following options are available to us to resolve the crisis: to open criminal cases for desertion against those who refuse to follow orders; to raise the salaries of officers and soldiers, hoping that this will bribe them."
rcw.16.a:0 "We shall deal with them as with deserters."
rcw.16.b:0 "Rise up salaries for them."
rcw.16.c:0 "Dissolve the Army."

rcw.17.t:0 "The End of Army Mutiny"
rcw.17.d:0 "We were able to cope with the unrest in the army and our armed forces are slowly starting to return to normal. This is a big victory for the government, and the leading party has dramatically increased its popularity among the population. Despite the fact that the army still does not trust us, at least they have stopped rebelling."
rcw.17.a:0 "Great!"


### NRPR Democratic Events ###
#351-410 reserved for nrpr

rusdem.351.t:0 "Appeal to the Deputies of the Duma"
rusdem.351.d:0 "The Party of People's Republicans, led by Prime Minister Savinkov, today issued an appeal to the other members of the State Duma, where it called on the lower house of parliament to unite for the destruction of the stronghold of Kerenskyism, the monarchical-aristocratic Senate, which prevents the adoption of laws vital for the economy and stability in the country that can help ordinary people.\n\nLater, in the Tauride Palace, during a Duma meeting, Prime Minister Savinkov himself spoke from the rostrum, declaring the beginning of the fight against corruption in the ranks of senators and that the NRPR party would seek compliance with democratic and republican principles of the work of all chambers of parliament and the government. Savinkov noted that the program of his party, which honestly won the elections, is able to help the deteriorating economic situation, pull the peasantry out of the bondage of Kerensky's land reform, as well as the destruction of corruption among senators.\n\nSavinkov finished his speech with a quote: \"And while the senators, servants of German capital, are sitting there, robbing our people, they should keep in mind that we will fight for the rights of the peasants! And if they do not resign their mandates voluntarily, we will regard this as a coup!\""
rusdem.351.a:0 "The Senators must resign!"

rusdem.352.t:0 "Savinkov Meets Chernov"
rusdem.352.d:0 "Today, the Prime Minister visited the leader of the Duma faction of Socialist Revolutionaries, his former party member Viktor Chernov.\n\nChernov looked preoccupied, and even nervous, and it seems that he did not even hide this state of his. Savinkov and Chernov had a fairly formal conversation for an hour, in which they discussed the possible entry of the srs into a government coalition with the NRPR. However, after an hour, the doors of Chernov's office were closed to prying ears and eyes, and Savinkov and Chernov spent several more hours in private conversation.\n\nIt is not known for certain what the Prime Minister tried to negotiate with Chernov. It is quite possible that in order to resist the Senate, it needs other allies, and what is better than the Srs, whose ideology is largely the basis of the NRPR program. In addition, Savinkov himself was a Socialist-Revolutionary for a long time, namely, a participant and head of a Combat Organization.\n\nThe conversation remained a secret, at least for now, because when Savinkov and Chernov left the office, none of them said a word."
rusdem.352.a:0 "We will know the truth soon, probably."

rusdem.353.t:0 "Chernov Refused Cooperation With NRPR"
rusdem.353.d:0 "A few days passed after the meeting between the Prime Minister and Chernov. And now its results have become known. In a public speech, Viktor Chernov said that the Party of Socialist Revolutionaries will not cooperate with any party, organization or people who encroach on democracy, the constitution and freedom. It is obvious that Chernov meant the Party of People's Republicans, which means that the negotiations failed and the NPRR lost one more possible ally."
rusdem.353.a:0 "We won't forget this."

rusdem.354.t:0 "NRPR-PSR Coalition?"
rusdem.354.d:0 "A few days passed after the meeting between the Prime Minister and Chernov. And now its results have become known. Today it became known that the Socialist-Revolutionary Party will enter into a government coalition with the NRPR, in which Chernov himself will probably take the chair of the Minister of Agriculture. It seems that preparations for the socialization of the earth are in full swing. Nevertheless, as it became known, not everyone in the Socialist-Revolutionary party shares Chernov's position to unite with Savinkov in a coalition. One of the prominent figures of the Socialist-Revolutionary party, Nikolai Avksentiev, declared the illegitimacy of the coalition and called on all self-respecting Socialist-Revolutionaries who consider themselves really socialists to refrain from voting for the draft laws of the NPRR."
rusdem.354.a:0 "A new ally from the Past."

rusdem.355.t:0 "Secret Meeting With the Left SRs"
rusdem.355.d:0 "According to rumors, a secret meeting was held in Petrograd between representatives of the NRPR and the left srs. After Chernov's refusal to cooperate, it seems that Savinkov's view fell on more radical former party members. Despite the fact that now an alliance between anarcho-syndicalists and popular Republicans seems simply impossible, it is quite likely that for the sake of overthrowing the power of oligarchs and aristocrats from the Senate, even such a radical alliance takes place.\n\nIn any case, it is still impossible to say unequivocally whether such an alliance will be possible or not."
rusdem.355.a:0 "Time will tell."

rusdem.356.t:0 "NRPR-PLSR Coalition?"
rusdem.356.d:0 "What seemed impossible yesterday has become a reality today. Prime Minister Savinkov announced an alliance between the NPRR and the PLSR in the name of protecting the achievements of February and democracy. Together with one of the leaders of the Socialist-Revolutionary Party, Steinberg, Savinkov announced the immediate termination of the bourgeois power of the Senate, the final socialization of the land and the democratization of power in the republic.\n\nIt is unknown how long this alliance will last, but the fact remains that the two radical parties have united to achieve their own goals."
rusdem.356.a:0 "A very unexpected alliance, indeed."

rusdem.357.t:0 "Spiridonova Denounces NRPR"
rusdem.357.d:0 "Today, the Central Committee of the PLSR, headed by Maria Spiridonova, provided the general public with a resonant statement about the inadmissibility of the seizure of power by Savinkov's NRPR.\n\nThe Central Committee said that earlier the prime Minister's party had invited the left SRS to join the united anti-capitalist revolutionary front in order to fight the dominance of the Senate. Such a proposal was regarded by the left Socialists-Revolutionaries as a provocation and a substitution of concepts. Spiridonova stated that the ideas of the NRPR completely contradict the goals of the Party of Left Socialists-Revolutionaries, and that nothing can justify the people's Republicans, even the struggle against capitalists and aristocrats."
rusdem.357.a:0 "We don't even need them."

rusdem.358.t:0 "The Russian Revolutionary Front"
rusdem.358.d.psr:0 "Today, Prime Minister Savinkov announced the establishment of the Russian Revolutionary Front - an alliance between the NRPR and the PSR for the sake of fighting the authoritarianism of the Senate, mired in corruption and thirst for power. The Russian Revolutionary Front will demand the immediate resignation of all senators who do not belong to the parties that are members of the RRF.\n\nThe Russian Revolutionary Front is fighting for the rights of peasants, for the rights of all Russian peoples! Against the dominance of German capital! For free and fair elections! Against the autocracy of the Senate!"

rusdem.358.a:0 "A new force to resist the Senate!"

rusdem.359.t:0 "Appeal to the Russian People"
rusdem.359.d:0 "The Party of People's Republicans, led by Prime Minister Savinkov, today published an appeal to the people of Russia, in which it called on people to unite to destroy the stronghold of Kerenskyism, the monarchical and aristocratic Senate, which prevents the adoption of laws vital for the economy and stability in the country that can help ordinary people.\n\nLater, in the Tavrichesky Palace, during a meeting of the Duma, Prime Minister Savinkov himself spoke from the rostrum, announcing the beginning of the fight against corruption in the ranks of senators and that the NRPR party would strive to comply with the democratic and republican principles of the work of all chambers of parliament and the government. Savinkov noted that the program of his party, which honestly won the elections, is capable of helping the deteriorating economic situation, snatching the peasantry from the captivity of Kerensky's land reform, as well as destroying corruption among senators.\n\nSavinkov ended his speech with a quote: \"And while the senators, the servants of German capital, are sitting there, robbing our people, they should keep in mind that we will fight for the rights of the peasants! And if they do not voluntarily resign their mandates, we will regard this as a coup d'etat!\""
rusdem.359.a:0 "People, unite!"

rusdem.360.t:0 "The Solidarists Withdraw From NRPR"
rusdem.360.d:0 "The National Union of the New Generation party, or Solidarists, is a party organized recently by Russian youth who saw in Savinkov and his NRPR an excellent opportunity to promote their ideas. Together with other associations, such as Gorgulov's VNKPZ, the NSNP became part of the NRPR as a faction. Despite the fact that the NSNP was constantly suppressed under the influence of Savinkov's strong leadership, they considered it necessary to declare their withdrawal from the NRPR and the formation of a separate party.\n\nThis decision was made as a result of an open call on the part of Savinkov to overthrow the existing state institutions. Despite all the difficulties, and the fact that as a result of Kerensky's action, the Senate has become a stronghold of conservative forces, it is impossible to make such statements, especially in the run-up to the senate elections next year. The departure of the solidarists from the NRPR significantly affected the stability of the party, in addition to the fact that the People's Republicans lost a certain number of seats in the Duma and the Senate, Savinkov's reputation was damaged. However, he never intended to play democracy."
rusdem.360.a:0 "They were never true People's Republicans."

rusdem.361.t:0 "Savinkov Meets Kornilov"
rusdem.361.d:0 "General Lavr Kornilov is one of Boris Savinkov's old associates. Despite the fact that in the post-war period he moved away from politics and focused all his attention on the development of the armed forces, he and Savinkov remained in touch.\n\nFor several years, there have been rumors that Kornilov is ready to support Savinkov and his party in seizing power in the country. However, Kornilov is the head of the ROVS, and he still does not let go of connections with other generals, among whom there are many monarchists, and who do not particularly trust Savinkov. Kornilov will have to make a difficult choice, to support Savinkov in his upcoming fight against the Senate or to stay away, and this choice remains not obvious."
rusdem.361.a:0 "Will the meeting tell anything new?"

rusdem.362.t:0 "The Kornilov-Savinkov Alliance"
rusdem.362.d:0 "General Kornilov agreed to create a kind of alliance between the ROVS and the NRPR, openly supporting Savinkov and declaring the inadmissibility of destroying democracy in the country with the help of the Senate. His statement has already been regarded as thoughtless by many colleagues in the All-Military Union, including the director of the organization Ilyin, as well as such high-ranking officers as the vice-president of the ROVS Baron Wrangel and the head of the General Staff Anton Denikin.\n\nDespite the contradictions in the ROVS, now Kornilov's support is more important than ever for Savinkov, because the outcome of Russia's future depends on it."
rusdem.362.a:0 "Kornilov and Savinkov shall save holy Russia!"

rusdem.363.t:0 "The ROVS Won't Support Savinkov's Claims"
rusdem.363.d:0 "Today, the president of the ROVS, General Kornilov, together with the director of the organization, Ilyin, as well as Vice President Wrangel and Chief of the General Staff Denikin, made a joint statement that the Russian armed forces will act as a guarantor of peace and prosperity of Russian democracy. The Constitution, for which a lot of blood was shed in the civil war, should be preserved, and its observance is not subject to doubt.\n\nIn this regard, as Kornilov said, the prime minister of the country must respect the current Constitution and the law, and therefore has no right to dissolve the Senate."
rusdem.363.a:0 "Damn..."

rusdem.364.t:0 "'The All-Russian Ultimatum to the Senate'"
rusdem.364.d:0 "It seems that today is the X-day. Prime Minister Savinkov, speaking at a Duma meeting in the Tauride Palace today, ordered to lower two banners with the Russian tricolor behind his back, in the middle of which a crown of thorns and a sword were spread out.\n\nFrom the rostrum, Savinkov made a rather emotional speech, which he designated as "An All-Russian ultimatum to the Senate". In it, he said that on behalf of the majority of the Russian population who voted for him and his party, on behalf of the majority of people's representatives in the Duma who elected him prime minister, he calls on representatives of the upper house of parliament to immediately resign senatorial mandates within the next 5 days. Savinkov threatened that if the ultimatum is not fulfilled, the Senate will be dissolved by force with the use of the army, law enforcement agencies, the Fighting Organization of the NRPR, as well as initiative citizens who want to live in peace.\n\n'The senators will be expelled by popular anger. For all the vices committed against the Russian people, you will be punished!'"
rusdem.364.a:0 "Is this the beginning of the new Era?"

rusdem.365.t:0 "The Senators Resigns!"
rusdem.365.d:0 "Frightened by the ultimatum of the strongest party in the history of Russia, Senators from conservative parties resigned, fearing for their safety.\n\nFor the first time in the history of Russia, members of the upper house of parliament voluntarily resigned their powers for the sake of people, for the sake of freedom and the achievements of February. The success of the NRPR and Savinkov showed that only with the national support is peace and prosperity of Russia possible."
rusdem.365.a:0 "Long live Savinkov!"

rusdem.366.t:0 "The Senators Reject Ultimatum!"
rusdem.366.d:0 "The situation in the republic became tense as soon as it became known that the conservative senators refused the demands of the NRPR and declared that they would follow the Constitution.\n\nA statement was made by the representative of conservative senators, Grand Duke Dmitry Pavlovich, who declared Savinkov's demands unconstitutional and immoral, violating the rights and freedoms of citizens, including those with senatorial powers. In this regard, Dmitry Pavlovich called on the army and the people, as well as the Duma opposition to Savinkov, to unite for the sake of saving the republic from the coup of the NRPR and not to succumb to Savinkov's cheap populism."
rusdem.366.a:0 "Who he think he is?!"

rusdem.367.t:0 "National Revolution!"
rusdem.367.d:0 "After the Senators' rejection of the ultimatum's demands, it is time for serious changes. By order of Savinkov, BO-NRPR fighters were stationed in major Russian cities, primarily in Petrograd and Moscow, which, according to the Prime Minister, were convened to further protect the work of municipal and city administrative buildings.\n\nThe BO-NRPR actually seized the entrances and exits to the Tauride Palace in Petrograd, as well as to the Moscow City Duma. Armed patrols are marching through the streets. It seems that the country is slowly sliding into anarchy, but so far everything looks quite calm. Savinkov urged citizens not to go out if possible, as sabotage by Senators is possible.\n\nIn addition, today, for the first time in many decades, the latest issue of the morning newspaper was not published in Moscow, as the printing house was blocked by the BO-NRPR. While there is a situation of uncertainty in the country, we need to start acting."
rusdem.367.a:0 "The situation seems to be under control."

rusdem.368.t:0 "The Shameful Stigma Of Monarchism"
rusdem.368.d:0 "Today, the newspapers presented the appeal of Prime Minister Savinkov with the propaganda of People's Republicanism. In it, he harshly went through the monarchist senators, whom he literally accused of being enemies of the people. The monarchy is the last century, and the February Revolution put an end to this relic of the past. Savinkov urged the population to forget about the return of the monarchy and the throne to Russia, because this path will be disastrous. Having criticized monarchism, Savinkov also condemned the monarchist senators who hold the majority in the Senate and do not allow the most important reforms for the people to be adopted."
rusdem.368.a:0 "Another blow to the monarchists!"

rusdem.369.d:0 "Now that the NPRR has a majority in the Senate, the new speaker of the Senate, a close friend of Savinkov, Dmitry Merezhkovsky, declared full support for the Prime Minister in his bill on merging the Prime-minister and President offices.\n\nThe following Bill, as has Merezhkovsky mentioned, is a revolutionary to the political system in Russia. By giving our Prime-Minister broad powers to govern the country, we will ensure the victory of people, at first, and, secondly, will finally deal with the Kerensky's legacy of a presidency elected by a puppet Senate."
rusdem.369.a:0 "So that what the NRPR wanted?"

rusdem.370.t:0 "Private Talk to the Constitutional Court"
rusdem.370.d:0 "Today it became known that some people meet with judges of the Constitutional Court during private conversations behind closed doors about the upcoming bill on combining the posts of Prime Minister and president. Despite the fact that many politicians have already dubbed this as undisguised lobbying and even bribery, today Savinkov spoke in the Duma, where he said that he opposes the corruption of officials, and private conversations were nothing more than consultations about the future bill.\n\nSavinkov also noted that if there is a majority in the Duma and the Senate, he does not need to lobby the Constitutional Court, since all the formal requirements for changing the constitution have already been achieved."
rusdem.370.a:0 "That sounds reasonable."

rusdem.371.t:0 "Savinkov's Address to the Constitutional Court"
rusdem.371.d:0 "Today, Prime Minister Savinkov addressed the judges of the Constitutional Court with an official statement that they are obliged to adopt amendments to the Constitution of the RDFR on the basis of the fact that the NRPR has popular support among the majority of the population. In case of refusal to accept the amendments, Savinkov promises to raise a popular uprising against illegitimate pro-German judges.\n\nDespite the fact that many politicians have already regarded Savinkov's speech as destructive to the foundations of the constitutional system of Russia, many citizens understand the need to adopt such a law in order to save the country from the chaos of Black Monday."

rusdem.372.t:0 "The Constitutional Court Examines the Bill"
rusdem.372.d:0 "The Constitutional Court of [RUS.GetNameDef] has announced that as Savinkov's Bill requires changes in the Constitution, the Court will examine this case closely and and will make a decision on the admissibility of the adoption of such amendments or not."

rusdem.373.t:0 "The Constitutional Court Refused Amendments"
rusdem.373.d:0 "The Constitutional Court has rejected changes in the Constitution. Unfortunately, that is not the solution the prime-minister wanted, so he has announced the deployment of the Combat Squads and the beginning of the National Revolution."
rusdem.373.a:0 "Call the Combat Squads!"

rusdem.374.t:0 "The Constitutional Court Changes the Constitution"

rusdem.376.t:0 "Savinkov Deploys Combat Squads"
rusdem.376.d:0 "Today, Prime Minister Savinkov said that the NRPR is not going to give up and will not allow the country to plunge further into chaos. The combat detachments stationed in Moscow and Petrograd were ordered to seize the most important administrative buildings to seize power in the country. The same orders were received by the BO-NRPRR detachments in other cities.\n\nIt remains only to determine our most important priorities - what we should capture first in Petrograd."

rusdem.377.t:0 "The Duma Captured"
rusdem.377.d:0 "The Combat Squads of the NRPR broke into the Tauride Palace, capturing it and announcing the dissolution of the Duma. Nevertheless, this step was perceived by Savinkov's opponents as reckless, given the majority of People's Republicans in parliament. The Duma building was surrounded by police officers who demanded to surrender."
rusdem.377.b:0 "Hold the deputies as hostages and ask the Police to put down weapons."
rusdem.377.c:0 "We need help of the Russian Army - and Kornilov."

rusdem.378.t:0 "The Senate Captured"
rusdem.378.d:0 "The NRPR Combat Squads broke into the Senate building, dissolving the current cabinet and arresting the monarchist senators. Despite the rather dangerous situation, the revolutionary people began to gather on the streets, demanding the resignation of the monarchists and the establishment of the power of the people's Republicans. Riots broke out in the city, but the police were able to break through to the Senate, surrounding it and demanding that the BO-NRPRR surrender."
rusdem.378.a:0 "Hold the senators as hostages and ask the Police to put down weapons."

rusdem.379.t:0 "The Police Started Shooting"
rusdem.379.d:0 "Despite the fact that we took high-ranking officials hostage, the police ignored our demands, demanding that they immediately stop the terror and surrender. Soon, a shootout began between individuals, both from the police and from armed Combat Squads. A decision must be made immediately."
rusdem.379.a:0 "Return fire - and hope they put down weapons."

rusdem.380.t:0 "Savinkov Arrested"
rusdem.380.d:0 "The current Prime Minister Savinkov was arrested by local police units for organizing a coup. Despite the presence of armed people's Republican revolutionaries, it seems that the fate of Russia now definitely depends only on its people."
rusdem.380.a:0 "The mutiny was suppressed."
rusdem.380.b:0 "People rise in Savinkov's support."

rusdem.381.t:0 "Kornilov Deploys Army in the City."
rusdem.381.d:0 "Seeing the presence of army units, cadets and shock troops, the police laid down their weapons, and the revolutionaries managed to occupy key administrative buildings. Despite the fact that the head of the army supported Savinkov as the legitimately elected prime minister of the country, much depends on other generals, especially monarchists."
rusdem.381.a:0 "The coup succeeded - proclaim Savinkov the Vozhd." 

rusdem.382.t:0 "The Police Puts Their Weapons Down."
rusdem.382.d:0 "The police agreed to lower their weapons, and many policemen began to surrender under the pressure of the revolutionary people and the legitimately elected Prime Minister. Thanks to the inaction of the police, the BO-NRPR was able to seize the remaining key administrative buildings, including the main police headquarters of Petrograd."
rusdem.382.a:0 "The coup succeeded - proclaim Savinkov the Vozhd."

rusdem.383.t:0 "The Provisional Government"
rusdem.383.d:0 "Now the chaos, caused by Savinkov, has finally ended. The NRPR still hold the majority in the Duma. We might dissolve it and call for another snap elections and maintain the rule in the hands of a new provisional government, consisting of opposition to Savinkov's rule."
rusdem.383.a:0 "Call the Snap Elections as soon as possible."

rusdem.384.t:0 "Kornilov Refused To Support Savinkov"
rusdem.384.d:0 "Despite some sympathy and even friendliness of Kornilov towards Savinkov, he refused to bring troops into the city, probably under the influence of other officers. Without the support of the army, the combat detachments of the NPRR failed to capture key administrative buildings, and now all hope is in the Russian people."
rusdem.384.a:0 "The mutiny was suppressed."
rusdem.384.b:0 "People rise in Savinkov's support."

rusdem.385.t:0 "Third Russian Revolution"
rusdem.385.d:0 "These events will someday be evaluated in history as nothing more than the third Russian Revolution. On the wave of mass popularity of the people's Republicans and the cult of the personality of the Leader Savinkov, the Russian people rose to a protest uprising against the power of embezzlers, monarchists and other destroyers of the Motherland.\n\nThe rebels have already captured Petrograd and Moscow, but especially quickly the peasant southern regions of the country are passing under their control, where the popularity of the NPRR is off the scale."
rusdem.385.a:0 "For Vozhd!"

rusdem.386.t:0 "Fate of Russia in Kornilov's Hands"
rusdem.386.d:0 "Perhaps even with some surprise for Kornilov himself, the power in the country turned out to be in his hands. Having an improvised army at hand, it cost him nothing to declare himself the supreme ruler, because, as the history of Russia shows, once again nothing good comes out of democracy. On the other hand, in order to avoid even greater losses, it may be worth putting power in the hands of the interim government and holding new elections."
rusdem.386.a:0 "Kornilov will save Holy Russia!"
rusdem.386.b:0 "Call the Snap Elections as soon as possible."

rusdem.387.t:0 "Third Russian Revolution"
rusdem.387.d:0 "Kornilov refused to support Savinkov, leaving some part of the army under his control as a force opposing the People's Republicans. However, this is not able to break the Russian spirit, which is protesting against deprivation. Kornilov may not be with us, but we are against him! Many soldiers go over to the side of the people, leaving Kornilov's army without the best fighters of the fatherland.\n\nNevertheless, the situation is getting worse, turning into riots, armed clashes with the wounded. It seems that everything is going to a full-fledged war. However, everything now depends on Kornilov. Savinkov has already sent him an ultimatum demanding that he surrender and resign for the benefit of the people, before it's too late. Otherwise, Savinkov announced that he would force Kornilov to leave."
rusdem.387.a:0 "He must resign now!"

rusdem.388.t:0 "Kornilov Gives Up!"
rusdem.388.d:0 "General Kornilov has resigned as the Chief of the Russian Army, therefore, surrendering all the opposition forces. It is time for us to celebrate our victory. Though, some monarchist generals have escaped to the Far-East, fearing trials, this loss is not too significant."
rusdem.388.a:0 "Long live Vozhd!"

rusdem.389.t:0 "Kornilov Ignores the Ultimatum"
rusdem.389.d:0 "General Kornilov has ignored the ultimatum we sent and escaped to Volgograd, where he started to build up defences and call for the Second Volunteer Army to fight against us. Well, he made his choice, now he will regret it."

Moreover, he spoke of once again reviving the coalition with KDP.\n\nThe Prime Minister's speech provoked both notes of approval among sympathizers and sharp criticism from the opposition, who accused Zenzinov of substituting facts and hardly possible fulfillment of promises, saying that the SRS were the party of shame under Kerensky, and will remain so."

Filled with authoritarian politicians who do not want to carry out reforms, the Senate remains a relic of the past. There is no doubt for the government that the Senate should be disbanded and replaced by a State Council, presumably consisting of representatives of all Russian regions. In addition, the government believes that it is necessary to change the procedure for electing the president, either by making it popular or by limiting the presidential power."

While Nekrasov, being more left-wing, declared his full readiness to cooperate with us, Nabokov criticized this decision and said that cooperation between the KDP and the PSR had already lasted for 15 years and it had not led to anything good.\n\nThe meeting of the Kadet Party on the parliamentary coalition with us is nearing its end, and it is unknown what decision the Central Committee will make."

This was another step on the way to the democratization of our society. Long live freedom, equality, fraternity!\n\nAt the same time, not everyone found the adoption of this law a positive moment. There was a final break between our party and the right-wing Kadets of Nabokov, who were firmly entrenched in the opposition. Relations also deteriorated with other socialist parties that opposed the law, namely the Mensheviks and the NSP. On the contrary, Savinkov's NRPR has improved relations with us, because it was precisely because of Kerensky that the break occurred in many ways.\n\nIn any case, Russia will no longer be the same."

Relations also improved with other socialist parties that opposed the law, namely the Mensheviks and the NSP. On the contrary, Savinkov's NRPR has worsened relations with us, because the socialization of the land has not been carried out.

rusdem.418.d:0 "In connection with the acute political crisis that arose as a result of the failed vote on the socialization of the land, an extraordinary congress of the Central Committee of the PSR was convened to discuss further actions. In general, the discussion was divided into two main currents.\n\nThe first, proposed by the leaders of the so-called Center-Left socialists-revolutionaries, Gerstein and Volsky, was the need for a radical solution to the land issue, namely, unification with other socialist forces for the triumph of democracy, the creation of a homogeneous socialist government and the rejection of bourgeois-democratic principles.\n\nThe second, proposed by the majority of right-wing SRs, led by Zenzinov and Avksentiev, was the adoption of a compromise bill on land quotas, which would allow full-fledged socialization of land in certain regions in need, and taking into account the national and cultural component. In addition, land under private ownership would be subject to an additional luxury tax.\n\nVoting among the members of the Central Committee was mainly on the side of the right-wing Kadets, but perhaps Chernov's authority can play a role in the vote. Despite all the decentralization of the PSR, its leader still had little influence on decision-making."

Cooperation with the left srs of course only increased suspicions, and many politicians began to hear speeches about an attempt to usurp power on the part of the SRS. Most of all, such rhetoric was of course from the monarchists and conservatives, as well as members of the ROVS.\n\nIt is possible that the union of Socialists-Revolutionaries will put an end to the showdowns within the Russian socialist movement, however, it is possible that this is only the beginning of the complete end of narodism."

They received their greatest flourishing during the Civil War, entering various governments of the white forces. However, with the end of the civil war, the oblasts did not receive full autonomy, and Siberia remained under the control of federal forces.\n\nEverything changed in 1925, when a number of regional officials supported Kolchak and announced the creation of the East Siberian Autonomy, which became part of the Far Eastern Republic of Transamura. As we know, Kolchak tried to maintain the balance of power and promised the Oblasts to grant autonomy as soon as he regained control over the whole of Russia. However, now that Kerensky is gone, we can consider a bill on granting autonomy to Siberia, thereby increasing our support among the regionalists and residents of Siberia.\n\nThe project implies the creation of a full-fledged autonomy on the entire territory of Siberia with its own government and parliament - the Siberian Regional Duma."

The return of the united Socialist-Revolutionary party will have a favorable impact not only on the party itself, but also will allow creating a strong ruling coalition.\n\nThat is why today in Petrograd, Prime Minister Zenzinov met with Boris Savinkov himself. The former socialist revolutionary, now the charismatic leader of the NRPR, and the prime minister had a long conversation and discussed key issues of creating a coalition. Among the disadvantages, experts say, is the role of the leader of the organization, which Savinkov will undoubtedly claim, so it is not a fact that the coalition will be stable."

We can be sure that if the PSR had any obligations with other parties, they are definitely terminated, and relations are spoiled. Despite the fact that the majority of the members of the NRPR are former social revolutionaries, the ideologies of the two parties differ, which means that each party will pull the blanket of state administration over itself. With the creation of the parliamentary coalition, new ministers from the NRPR were invited to the Cabinet of Ministers, who took the chairs of the Minister of Foreign Affairs and the Minister of Internal Affairs, so it seems that now all state affairs are under the control of Savinkov."

Thus, the president will actually be appointed by the current government, which will avoid conflict situations between these two institutions of executive power. The Duma will oversee the activities of the president, that is, the president will no longer be accountable to the Senate.\n\nIn addition, the Senate reform will abolish the socio-demographic qualification for senate elections, making them nationwide. The right to appoint 50 Senators will remain with the president.\n\nIn general, the Senate will become more democratic, and will truly represent the interests of citizens, and our political system will become even more free and open."

In connection with this appointment, Avksentiev announced the adoption of a new party code, as well as the replacement of some ideological principles in connection with adaptation to a new era in the history of the party.\n\nSo, Avksentiev said that since the revolutionary ideology no longer symbolizes the party, its name will be changed to the "Party of Socialist Reformists". Avksentiev suggested that, in this way, the party will be able to attract even more supporters and show peaceful and democratic intentions. Since the party's abbreviation will remain PSR, it will not lose supporters. In addition, Avksentiev said that the ideology of the party will remain the same, but the party will move away from the exclusively peasant agenda in connection with the disappearance of the peasantry as a class in order to represent wider segments of the population.\n\nThe decision of the Central Committee was massively criticized by the center-left of the party, whose unofficial leaders are Gerstein and Volsky, to the point that many of them chose to leave the party. According to sources, many of that minority have already joined more" left-wing " peasant parties, namely, joined the PLSR and the NSP."

The deep party split, which has lasted since the civil war, does not allow us to effectively start state reforms.\n\nAt the moment, the leader of the party is already quite elderly Alexander Potresov, one of the founders of the RSDRP and an ardent supporter of reformism. Under his auspices, the party became a key agitator of workers ' rights and many Mensheviks were appointed to key positions, and trade unions became almost completely controlled by the Mensheviks. As the head of the party, Potresov established contacts with the Socialist-Revolutionaries and Kadets, and became their close ally.\n\nAt the same time, until 1927, the Central Committee of the RSDRP was dominated by the left Menshevik internationalists under the leadership of Raphael Abramovich, a member of the Bund, who openly cooperate with the Third International. In connection with the death of Kerensky and the victory in the elections, it seems that it is necessary to convene a new congress of the Central Committee and determine who should be in charge."

Thus, it is proposed not to create a certain territorial autonomy, due to the widespread settlement of Jews, but to grant the Bund powers to implement cultural and educational policy in the interests of the Jewish population, primarily the working class."

Together with Plekhanov, another founder of Menshevism, he founded the group "Liberation of Labor", was one of the leaders of the Second International.\n\nAnd these are not the only achievements of Askelrod. It was he who achieved the unity of the party in the years after the civil war and thanks to him, internal party differences have not been so strong for the last almost 10 years. Askelrod, an ideological supporter of reformism and an alliance with the bourgeoisie, building a state where workers and capitalists can live in peace, laid the foundations for the successful rule of the Menshevik party.\n\nThe memory of him and his achievements should be perpetuated, and that is why the government initiated the renaming of one of the central streets in Moscow to Askelrod Street."

It is understandable, but the Councils themselves as a system of collective management are one of the best types of local self-government. Since the Civil War, there have been many councils in Russia, but they are all characterized by different structures and limited in their decisions.\n\nThe Mensheviks ' proposal is to create a federal system of councils of different levels, which will be formed first into municipalities, and then into a federal legislative body of each region. This will give the regions more autonomy in the adoption of local laws and create a fair system of representation of the population."

Thus, the deputies of the RSDRP announced a reform of the Senate, which will get rid of presidential senators and instead expand the number of regional senators to 75, as well as elected senators to 75.\n\nThus, half of the Senate will be elected by the population, and the other half by the legislative regional bodies, also elected by the population. It turns out that the Senate will become fully democratically elected, which will save us from the authoritarian system partially operating in the upper house of parliament.\n\n"

Since many of those who are now in the government and the Central Committee are representatives of left Menshevism, they decided to establish a separate party - the Russian Socialist Workers' Party of Interationalists, or RSRPI.\n\nThese same people had already attempted to create this party, even during the Civil War, when they wanted to support the Bolsheviks, but soon the Reds finally lost, and the RSRPI was never able to form itself into a separate party. Now it was her turn. The citizens of Russia should know that our party stands for workers ' socialism and internationalism, which will be officially reflected in our name."

However, the full socialization of the land will not happen. Instead, as the Prime Minister suggested, normal capitalist relations will develop in the village, as well as broad control over the protection of the land rights of peasants will be deployed. In this regard, the National Agrarian Fund will also be created, from which peasant allotments will be subsidized annually, developing agriculture and securing a good harvest."

rusdem.503.t:0 "Protection of Workers' Rights"
rusdem.503.d:0 "The big problem of Russia since the time of the Bolsheviks is the question of workeres. Despite the fact that most of the workers' rights were enshrined in the Constitution, for a long time the agrarian party of the Socialist-Revolutionaries was in power, which did little to support the proletariat. The Nekrasov government intends to correct this mistake by guaranteeing the full right of workers to strike. In addition, the KDP intends to seriously deal with the capitalists - owners of factories, and in case of excesses, immediately dismiss the managers. The working day will be reduced to 8 hours, and workers' salaries will be increased, largely due to budget cuts for the police and the army, which, although they also require development and attention from the state, do not need it so much at the moment."

The Nekrasov government plans to change this measure by amending the electoral law and making the elections of senators nationwide by analogy with the elections to the Duma. Such a measure will be able to increase the effectiveness of popular representation in the upper house of parliament, and moreover, will prepare the ground for further senate reform - namely, the abolition of presidential senators."

However, unlike Nabokov, who leans towards a constitutional monarchy, progressives favor a federal republic with a strong president. Nekrasov believes that it is necessary to preserve the unity of the party, and therefore the progressive Konovalov should be invited to the government."

He has been promoting constitutional monarchy and market liberalism for many years, but now a new person will take his place. And despite everything, it seems that this person will be Alexander Konovalov - a progressive and entrepreneur, who, unlike his predecessor, stands not for a constitutional monarchy, but for a strong presidential power. However, since he takes the place of the Minister of Economy, it seems that the Kadet party will become even more unified."

rusdem.507.t:0 "Backward Judicial System"
rusdem.507.d:0 "The Russian judicial system is undoubtedly outdated and needs to be changed as soon as possible. The fact is that in practice, the judicial reform of 1864, built under the tsar and the aristocracy, continues to operate, as a result of which the masses of the people remain largely defenseless. Despite the fact that the judicial system was changed after the Constituent Assembly, the changes were largely insignificant. The judicial system remained too cumbersome and inconvenient, as well as essentially open to corruption. It is necessary to develop a new clear judicial system with a certain hierarchy and levels, as well as to federalize this system by combining various regional and district courts under a single Supreme Court of the Russian Republic."

The successful reforms of Nekrasov and his 'New Tactics' helped the Russian Republic to become what it should have been 15 years ago. The era of the plutocratic tsars and Kerenshchiny has passed into oblivion. From now on, our legal, free and democratic state will be an example for other countries, especially Eastern European ones."
rusdem.508.d.nosenatereform:0 "Despite the fact that the Duma failed to win and carry out the reform of the Senate, many democratic reforms were undertaken and carried out. Their effectiveness will still be appreciated by time and future generations.

He began his speech by describing his strategy, calling it an 'Old Deal', apparently in order to ridicule Nekrasov's 'New Tactics'.\n\nDespite his determination, such an outburst did not go unnoticed by the left wing of the party, which criticized the prime minister for worsening the image of the party and introducing a split, simultaneously condemning his preference for outdated ideas of a consensual monarchy. In any case, Nabokov will probably soon do something to promote the ideas of a constitutional monarchy, otherwise his government will be doomed."

Therefore, we have two proposals under consideration.\n\nThe first is to introduce progressive taxation, which will allow the poor to give a smaller part of their income, and the rich to pay more taxes. Such a proposal, of course, will not suit the rich, but it will suit the majority of the population.\nThe second is to reduce the income tax to 14%. It will also satisfy the poor, who will pay less than they do now, and at the same time the popularity of our government will greatly increase. Despite the fact that the budget will suffer from such a reduction, we hope to recapture these costs with the help of fiscal reform."

When Alexander II abolished serfdom and granted freedom to the peasants, Tsarist Russia forced them to pay taxes and pay debts for land. Then the Bolsheviks came. Having taken the land from the people, they gave it to the people, and then the war began and they took away their last crop, famine and death began. Then came the era of Kerensky, who decided not to take the land from ordinary peasants completely. He allowed them to work on the land, cultivate it and grow food. But at the same time, he deprived millions of other peasants who lived near the cities where the capitalists seized the land of this right. And, finally, the era of the Cadets has come. A fair and honest era, where people were given the right to privatize land, where the government began to control monopolists, and gave the peasants the right to enrich themselves.\n\nThere are no more peasants. This era has finally sunk into oblivion. Now there is a Russian Farmer-entrepreneur who feeds Europe and Russia. An entrepreneur who receives fair money for his work, who sets the price for his services and goods himself. This is the triumph of capitalism - this is the triumph of democracy."

The party, like the other Russian parties, is divided, and each of the leading persons in the party is playing his own game.\n\nOn the one hand, the formal leader of the party, Vasily Shulgin, is a convinced monarchist, a former Black-Hundredist, who, however, is not inherent in chauvinism. His main goal is to restore the constitutional monarchy and create a large right-wing coalition.\n\nOn the other hand, the informal leader of the party, Dmitry Romanov, although he is one of the main contenders for the Russian throne, has his own power as the main goal. He is not close to a constitutional monarchy, or rather, he does not trust the masses and seeks to strengthen the power of the Senate. But in this case, it will be necessary to rely on the pro-republican Eurasianists.\n\nThere is also a third player, Felix Yusupov. A close associate of Dmitry Romanov, he is convinced of the need to transfer power to large capital, oligarchs, which he himself is to some extent. Of course, this includes strengthening the Senate.\n\nThus, there are two ways - to rely on the aristocracy, or on large capital. Creating a coalition with the monarchists or Republicans will do its job."
rusdem.526.a:0 "We should rely on aristocracy"
rusdem.526.b:0 "We should rely on oligarchy"

rusdem.527.d:0 "Vasily Shulgin, once one of the best speakers of the Duma, a man who took the abdication of the monarchy into his hands and always tried to restore it, lost.\n\nAlready in the 1920s, he became a political outsider, but he managed to unite all the conservative and right-wing organizations in the country and create an opposition to Kerensky. The opposition, which will soon occupy the Senate and will dictate its terms. But everything comes to an end. And the referendum on the restoration of the monarchy, so desired by Shulgin, failed. Like Shulgin himself, now cursed and hated by everyone.\n\nWe can only hope that the new prime minister will lead the party out of the crisis."

#rusdem.551-575 for monarchy referendum
rusdem.551.t:0 "The Monarchy Referendum"
rusdem.551.d:0 "In order to hold a referendum on the restoration of the monarchy, it is necessary to make several initial decisions, the main of which is to put the relevant issue to a vote in the Duma and the Senate. Without this action, we are doomed to failure."
rusdem.551.a:0 "What are we waiting for?"

rusdem.552.t:0 "The Monarchy Referendum Bill Passed!"
rusdem.552.d:0 "Today, the law on holding the monarchy referendum was signed by the President [ROOT.GetLeader] with both of the chambers of the parliament voting for holding it. While it is already a great victory, there are plenty of things to do as well."
rusdem.552.a:0 "Time to start."

rusdem.553.t:0 "The Monarchy Referendum Bill Fails!"
rusdem.553.d:0 "Today, the law on holding the monarchy referendum has failed, and it seems there are no legal ways we can ensure it to be held. This is a disaster for the current political party and its prime-minister with it losing a great ammount of support and popularity."
rusdem.553.a:0 "A disaster!"

rusdem.554.t:0 "The Referendum in 3 Months!"
rusdem.554.d:0 "The date of the referendum was announced-in 3 months. A lot has to be done during this time, and our main task now is to achieve an increase in the popularity of the monarchy among the population, as well as a high turnout. If the turnout is less than 50%, the referendum will be considered invalid."
rusdem.554.a:0 "Everything should go smooth."

rusdem.555.t:0 "Shulgin's Suggestion"
rusdem.555.d:0 "Vasily Shulgin, an inveterate monarchist and leader of the VNS, today addressed the top party leadership and shared his proposal for a new candidate for the Russian throne. In his opinion, after the abdication of Nicholas II and the confusion in the order of succession that arose as a result of all the events, there is no urgent need to restore the Romanov dynasty.\n\nAlthough Shulgin formally supports Roman Petrovich as a legitimate candidate for the tsarist throne, he sees an equally important figure in the framework of rallying the people and restoring a strong government... Pyotr Wrangel! According to him, it is Wrangel who is able to save Russia from a catastrophe, and his popularity among both the population and the army will contribute to the stability of the government.\n\nAs Shulgin said, he had already had a conversation with Wrangel himself on this issue, and the Black Baron was not against it if it was necessary to save Russia."
rusdem.555.a:0 "Wrangel is the best candidate."
rusdem.555.b:0 "The Romanovs have more rights to the throne."

rusdem.556.t:0 "Choosing the Candidate"
rusdem.556.d:0 "One of the most basic issues of the referendum is not so much the restoration of the monarchy itself, but who exactly will be the new Emperor of All-Russia.\n\nAfter the murder of Nicholas II and his family, as well as his brother Mikhail Alexandrovich, opinions about who should lead the dynasty were divided. Approximately 40% support Grand Duke Kirill Vladimirovich and his heirs as a contender for the throne. Opponents also refer to the fact that his marriage was not recognized by Nicholas II, or there is no clear confirmation of this.\n\nThe second main contender for the throne is the current speaker of the Senate, Grand Duke Dmitry Pavlovich, who, unlike Kirill, has no legal obstacles to the rights to the throne. However, it symbolizes the old aristocratic system and is not so popular with the masses.\n\nIn third place is the young prince Vsevolod Ioannovich, who is barely 20 years old, but at the same time enjoys wide popularity among the population as a young aristocrat who never lived under the tsarist autocracy. The fourth candidate for the throne, Prince Roman Petrovich, is also competing with Vsevolod Ioannovich, who is also quite young and ambitious. Prince Andrey Alexandrovich, patron of the Maltese Order of Orthodox Knights of St. John of Jerusalem, closes the trinity of young candidates"

rusdem.557.t:0 "Choosing the Candidate"
rusdem.557.d:0 "There are other candidates for the throne who are not widely popular at the same time.\nThe first of them is Kirill Vladimirovich's brother, Boris, who is also in a morganatic marriage and has no children, which will raise the question of succession to the throne once again at some time.\nThe second is the illegitimate son of the brother of the last tsar, Mikhail Alexandrovich, George, still, however, a minor, but considered legitimate by some of his supporters.\nThe third is this... Tsarevna Anastasia... However, her legitimacy is zero, since none of the representatives of the dynasty really recognizes her as the daughter of the last king.\n\nUnder certain circumstances, other candidates may arise."
rusdem.557.a:0 "Boris I"
rusdem.557.b:0 "Georgiy under the name of Mikhail II"

rusdem.557.e:0 "Previous candidates were better"

rusdem.558.t:0 "Monarchist Eurasianists Join the Game"
rusdem.558.d:0 "With choosing Andrei I as the official heir to the Russian throne, some of the Eurasianists, most notably, Konstantin Chkheidze, has announced their allegiance to the monarchist cause.\n\nAs Chkheidze has said, despite most of the Eurasianists are republicans, nothing really changes for them after Restoration. So, he asked the others to promote the Referendum."

The announcement was made by Ivan Ilyin, the ideologue of the ROVS and its current public relations director, who stated that Pyotr Wrangel's candidacy best suits the changes in the Russian Monarchist movement, and that the Hero of War, the Black Baron, will become a great symbol of the renewed Russian Imperialism."
rusdem.559.d:0 "The Russian All-Military Union has officially announced its support of the chosen candidate to the Russian Throne. The announcement was made jointly by Ivan Ilyin, the ideologue of the ROVS and its current public relations director, and vice-president Pyotr Wrangel. The announcement stated that the candidacy of [GetRussianMonarchCandidate] best suits the renewed age of Russian Imperalism and that the elected Senate and Duma together with the Tsar will make up a good and long story of cooperation."
rusdem.559.a:0 "The Monarchists of Russia, unite!"

rusdem.560.t:0 "The Romanovs Criticize the Candidate Choice"
rusdem.560.d:0 "Members of the Imperial House of Romanov declared that the chosen candidate at the referendum does not correspond at all to the laws on succession to the throne, nor to common sense. The split that exists in the imperial house on the issue of succession to the throne, the rejection of morganatic marriages, has long divided the Romanovs into those who support the line of Kirill Vladimirovich, and those who advocate other branches.\n\nNow that the heir to the throne has been officially elected, it seems that the house of Romanov is divided as never before, and in the future, we may face the consequences of this split."
rusdem.560.a:0 "Well..."

rusdem.561.t:0 "The Romanovs Question the Candidate Choice"
rusdem.561.d:0 "Despite the fact that in fact George was the recognized son of Mikhail Alexandrovich, he was granted the title of Prince, this does not negate the fact that he was an illegitimate child. If we proceed from the fact that Mikhail was de jure the last emperor of Russia, his son, of course, may have some rights to the throne. Ultimately, the opinions of a member of the House of Romanov on this matter differ, but most of them agree that there are candidates with great rights to the throne."
rusdem.561.a:0 "Well..."

rusdem.562.t:0 "The Romanovs Outrage by the Candidate Choice"
rusdem.562.d.anastasia:0 "After the decision to crown...

It is unknown whether the referendum will be held calmly, but we should expect provocations."

rusdem.562.a:0 "Is she really so fake?"
rusdem.562.b:0 "They ruined the country, and Wrangel will rebuild it."

rusdem.563.t:0 "The Socialists Protest the Referendum"
rusdem.563.d:0 "As expected, it is not surprising that all the socialist parties, without exception, have protested against the holding of a referendum, which, in their opinion, will put an end to honest politics in Russia. The Socialists announced strikes, protests and called on all honest citizens to vote against the restoration of the monarchy, scaring them with the return of autocracy, the triumph of the capitalists and the oppression of the peasants and workers.\n\nWe must organize propaganda that the words of socialists are fiction, since under a constitutional monarchy they will still have the same rights and duties, and the role of the monarch will be symbolic."
rusdem.563.a:0 "Organise monarchist propaganda."

rusdem.564.t:0 "The General Public Endorses Young Prince"
rusdem.564.d:0 "In general, we can record an increase in sympathy towards the monarchy from the side of society, which can be attributed to the fact that the candidate we have chosen is young. The positive image in the media created by his supporters really helps to increase the popularity of the referendum, and it seems that even the monarchy itself."
rusdem.564.a:0 "That's great!"

rusdem.565.t:0 "Savinkov Denounces Referendum"
rusdem.565.d:0 "The Republican People's Party of Russia has declared the illegitimacy of the referendum. According to Boris Savinkov, the issue of the monarchy was resolved at the Constituent Assembly, a popularly elected body that decided that Russia is a republic and the corresponding Constitution was adopted.\n\nHe called the restoration of the Monarchy an illegal action that violates the stability of the country and its constitution. Savinkov urged people not to go to the vote, as it is not legitimate, and also called on the government to immediately cancel the referendum, or else they will face 'popular anger'."
rusdem.565.a:0 "Who he is to dictate us rules?"

rusdem.566.t:0 "Republican Propaganda"
rusdem.566.d:0 "No matter how much we want to remove all the pro-republican posters, they still exist. It is quite difficult to overshadow the propaganda that the Republicans have deployed, because all socialist parties and organizations, as well as Savinkovites, are engaged in it. Posters are trying to make the king an image of a villain, and the monarchy - a plague that consumes peoples. In addition, they often appeal to the past experience of autocracy. Vasily Shulgin was also criticized, who, despite all his progressiveness, is still accused after so many years of being a Black Hundred and a chauvinist who dreams of returning serfdom."
rusdem.566.a:0 "We must put more effort into our own propaganda."

rusdem.567.t:0 "Rigging the Results?"
rusdem.567.d:0 "The referendum is rapidly approaching, and many of the staff seem dissatisfied with the expected result and fear their loss. Anyway, the loss will really cost the initiators of the referendum dearly, up to the complete failure of the government and the disappearance of the monarchist parties from the Senate and the Duma. In order to avoid this kind of crisis, some (we will not name their names) proposed to fake the results of the referendum in order to ensure the victory of the monarchists."
rusdem.567.a:0 "It might work..."
rusdem.567.b:0 "It is too risky..."

rusdem.568.t:0 "Referendum Is Considered Failed"
rusdem.568.d:0 "Since the turnout at the referendum was less than 50% of the population, the referendum is considered invalid. This is a collapse and catastrophe for the right-wing Kadets and the VNS, and apparently the beginning of the end of their political career."
rusdem.568.a:0 "Republic Lives On!"

rusdem.569.t:0 "Republicans Win the Referendum!"
rusdem.569.d:0 "Since the turnout at the referendum was more than 50% of the population, the referendum is considered to have taken place. However, despite all the efforts of the VNS and the right-wing Kadets, they could not get more than half of the votes, and therefore today the election committee announced the victory of the Republicans and that the monarchy will not be restored!"

He left this post after Hetman Skoropadsky came to power. During the Hetmanate, he was elected chairman of the Kiev committee of the "Union of the Revival of Russia" and stayed there until the end of the Russian Civil War.\n\nIn 1920 Odinets moved back to Russia to find his party dissolved, and Boris Savinkov, as the only political figure Odinets believed could rule Russia. Soon he became his close confederate and ally, becoming one of the members of the Senate from NRPR in 1934.\n\nNow, elected as President of Russia, Odinets understands that his term will end as soon as Savinkov will merge the offices of Prime-Minister and President to become the only ruler himself."

RUS_LAW_PRESIDENT_PSR_KDP_REFORM_desc:0 "\n\nThe idea, proposed jointly by some PSR and most of KDP deputies is to make the President elected by the population, instead of the Senate. Therefore, the Senate will lose its right to appoint the President they want. Moreover, the President will be now supervised by the Government, which will remove the Senate's right to do it as well."
RUS_LAW_SENATE_RSDRP_REFORM_desc:0 "\n\nThe Senate Reform, proposed by the moderate RSDRP deputies will change the proportion of the Senators, changing it to 75 Regional Senators, 75 Elected Senators and totally getting rid of the senators, appointed directly by the President."
RUS_LAW_ABOLISH_SENATE_desc:0 "\n\nA rather radical idea, proposed by the internationalist wing of the RSDRP is to completely abolish the Senate, because of its uselessness."
RUS_LAW_MUNICIPAL_COUNCILS_desc:0 "\n\nThe RSDRP suggest we should create municipal councils: firstly, to improve local self-government; secondly, to ensure that workers are well represented; thirdly, our country is big and complex - and we need help at local levels."
RUS_LAW_FEDERAL_COUNCILS_desc:0 "\n\nFollowing the idea of municipal councils, we should create the federal councils as well - the ones that will represent population in the regions still withouth legislative initiative right, and second - to improve local parliaments, already existing."
RUS_LAW_AGR_SEC_AGENCY_desc:0 "\n\nThe RSDRP deputies believe that Russia has a stong agricultural potential: our country can feed whole Europe and help our close neighbours. To ensure that agriculture develops and prospers, we should create a special Agency to supervise peasants and farmers, of course at the cost of nationalizing the land."
RUS_UNIVERSAL_VOTING_SENATE_desc:0 "\n\nThe KDP deputies suggested to lift the voting restrictions for the Senate elections, allowing for all Russian citizens aged 20 or higher to participate in the elections."
RUS_LAW_HOLD_THE_MONARCHY_REFERENDUM_desc:0 "\n\nThe Referendum on Monarchy, before being held, should be first voted on. And only with consent with all chambers of Parliament and the President, it can take place."
RUS_LAW_FULL_LAND_PRIVATISATION_desc:0 "\n\nThe only way to solve the land issue - is to give it back into private hands - so both peasants, workers, businessmen... every citizen could enjoy the benefits of private ownership."
RUS_LAW_DESTROY_LOCAL_PARLIAMENTS_desc:0 "\n\nThe local parliaments and the whole division of our territory is considered to be a rather stupid decision. Our country shall be centralized in order for the government and central authorities to have full power in all Russian villages and cities."
RUS_LAW_EMPOWER_PRESIDENT_desc:0 "\n\nThe idea, suggested, is making Russia a presidential republic with a strong executive, who will be elected by all Russian citizens. In other words, the president now will be independent from the Parliament, and he will appoint the Prime-Minister with the Duma's consent, of course. If the Bill will be adopted, then the extraordinary Presidential elections will be held."
RUS_LAW_LIBERAL_TAX_desc:0 "\n\nThe suggested tax reform shall deal with our current 15% income tax, reducing it to 14%, though at the same time introducing a higher inheritance tax and awaiting the fiscal reform to fight back these money, though increasing popular image of our government."

RUS_LAW_AGRICULTURAL_ADJUSTMENT_desc:0 "\n\nThe Agricultural Adjustment Act follows our previous reforms in this field. It is focused on subsidizing farmers in order to mechanize agricultural sector and radically increase the yields and profits."
RUS_LAW_NATIONAL_CULTURAL_AUTONOMIES_desc:0 "\n\nWe shall respect our minorities and oppose Russification of them. Though territorial autonomies are too much, we can ensure that they can teach their own language and promote their cultures."

The industrial enterprises should be given to the autonomous Labour Collectives, united into a Federation of Syndicates. The consumption should be organized through the Cooperative Unions, united in the Federation of Cooperatives. The NSP, led by Bukharin, however, strongly disapproved of the idea, arguing that such radical changes to the society can be very harmful. Nevertheless, the Bill is in the Duma, and the voting will begin soon."

#rusdem.13.t:0 "New Economic Policy"
#rusdem.13.d:0 "Today, NSP deputies have introduced the bill called \"New Economic Policy\". Nikolay Bukharin, leader of the NSP, suggests that we should create a mixed economy: private property with planned socialist economy. He believes that this will help to unite village and city, improve the effeciency of the production and prove that socialism can coexist with capitalism. The only thing Bukharin did not mention is that he believes that NEP is a provisional measure needed for the complete socialist transition."

#rusdem.14.t:0 "Village Communes"
#rusdem.14.d:0 "Today, The PLSR deputies suggest the second part of the plan: create village communes - agricultural cooperatives. The farmers and peasants will share the labour and land and work together to ensure our future."

#rusdem.15.t:0 "Support the Kulaks"
#rusdem.15.d:0 "Who are the Kulaks? The NSP deputies state that Kulaks are rich peasant or farmers. Nikolay Bukharin believes that though kulaks are considered exploitators of the working class can be very useful for the government. By ensuring that Kulaks earn a lot of money, we will establish strong ties between our government and peasantry and between peasantry and workers."

#rusdem.16.t:0 "Strengthen Trade Unions"
#rusdem.16.d:0 "The PLSR deputies are fully committed to the idea that Trade Unions need more authority as they secure workers' rights as nobody else in the country. Though Bukharin and Tsereteli remain skeptical about giving much more power to trade unions, they are likely to accept this idea."

#rusdem.17.t:0 "Support Trade Unions"
#rusdem.17.d:0 "Bukharin himself believes that giving too much power to Trade Unions can get out of conrol. His approach considers that government is good at securing workers' rights, but we should probably give more money to Trade Unions to win their trust."

#rusdem.18.t:0 "Municipal Councils"

#rusdem.20.t:0 "Nationalize Railroads"
#rusdem.20.d:0 "The Central Committee of the RSDRP believes that railroads are vital: they unite our country - they transfer supplies and products and it is important to secure the railroads and protect them from rich landowners, who only seek to gain profit."

#rusdem.21.t:0 "Socialization of Land"
#rusdem.21.d:0 "The most ambitious plan of the PSR, partially implemented by Kerensky has a vital meaning to our country. For the long centuries rich landowners had exploited those who worked on these lands. We must finish this plan - make Russian Lands a common property of all Russian citizens."

#rusdem.22.t:0 "Local Parliaments"

#rusdem.26.d:0 "Pavel Milyukov has announced a huge plan to reform the economy. We must stimulate the economy not only to get rid of the Black Monday Crisis, but to ensure our country prospers for years. We should cut down the taxes and increase government purchases of goods and services."

#rusdem.25.t:0 "Liberal Tax Reform"
#rusdem.25.d:0 "We should give the authority of formation and realization of tax policy towards business to the regions of our federation. On the other hand, the government needs to cut down taxes for low profit households, but support a proportional income tax."

#rusdem.27.t:0 "Railroad Privatisation"

#rusdem.29.t:0 "Trade Unions Ban"
#rusdem.29.d:0 "The Trade Unions are only gaining money and becoming more and more dangerous for the stability. Our deputies suggest that workers know when their rights are violated themselves - why do they need trade unions?"

Surrounded by threats - Germans and Syndies in the West and Japanese Imperialists in the East - we should finally and officially form Eurasian Union to protect ourselves and our neighbours."

#rusdem.32.t:0 "Referendum on Monarchy"
#rusdem.32.d:0 "Since the very beginning of fragile Russian democracy, Vasiliy Shulgin - a staunch monarchist has argued that monarchy is vital for Russia.

#rusdem.33.t:0 "Merge the President and Prime-Minister posts"

rusdem.61.a:0 "Why have you participated in elections, then?"

#rusdem.58.t:0 "Reforming the Senate"
#rusdem.58.d:0 "The Senate is the institution that slows down Russian democracy and parliamentarism. The majority of the Senate is unelected and it is not really representative. Moreover, consisting of conservative and authoritarian senators, they interfere with our government and the Duma. We should reform the upper house of our parliament, so it won't inhibit social reforms."
