### Semyenov Events ###
transbaikalia.1.t:0 "Dealing With the Current Troubles"
transbaikalia.1.d:0 "Ataman Semyenov finally has the entire Transbaikal region at his disposal and can restore order in it with a firm hand.\n\nThe main problems at the moment are rampant crime, Siberian regionalists, socialist partisanship and Buryat-Mongolian separatism. To solve all the pressing problems, it is necessary to make a primary decision: to convene a People's Regional Council, or to leave the region in a state of martial law, so that nothing prevents the ataman from pursuing his policy."
transbaikalia.1.a:0 "Form the advisory council."
transbaikalia.1.b:0 "Maintain the martial law."

transbaikalia.2.t:0 "[FROM.GetName] Forms the Regional Council"
transbaikalia.2.d:0 "The recent news from the wild Transbaikalia are the following. Ataman Semyenov has established the People's Regional Council, an adivory body that is made up to deal with the current issues in the region, though without the approval of Semyenov, the laws have no legal force."

transbaikalia.2.b:0 "Demand he gets rid of the council."

transbaikalia.3.t:0 "[FROM.GetName] Demands Disbanding the Council"
transbaikalia.3.d:0 "Central Government in Vladivostok has demanded that we immediately disband the Council we have just established as this decision was made without permission of the Supreme Ruler."
transbaikalia.3.a:0 "Well..."
transbaikalia.3.b:0 "Who they are to tell us what to do?"

transbaikalia.4.t:0 "[FROM.GetName] Disbands the Council"
transbaikalia.4.d:0 "As demanded earlier, the People's Regional Council in Transbaikalia has been disbanded by Ataman Semyenov, bringing back the martial law. At least, they are still loyal to us."
transbaikalia.4.a:0 "Great."

transbaikalia.5.t:0 "[FROM.GetName] Refuses to Disband the Council"
transbaikalia.5.d:0 "Despite our demands, Ataman Semyenov refused to disband the council. Although this would normally be regarded as a betrayal and refusal to follow the order of the Supreme Ruler, in the conditions of martial law in Transbaikalia, it seems that we have no choice but to accept the Transbaikal Council as a fact."
transbaikalia.5.a:0 "This raises suspicions."

transbaikalia.6.t:0 "Semyenov's Appeal to the Buryat-Mongolian Nation"
transbaikalia.6.d:0 "Today, Ataman Semyenov, the governor of the Transbaikal Military District, appealed to all citizens who identify themselves as Buryat-Mongols with promises to soon give them broad autonomy and grant legislative and executive rights to Burnatskom.\n\nThe Buryat-Mongolian Autonomy will be officially established on the territory of Verkhneudinsk and in the surrounding lands. Nevertheless, as long as martial law is in effect in the region, all supreme power will belong to Ataman Semyenov."
transbaikalia.6.a:0 "A great victory for Buryat-Mongol people."

transbaikalia.7.t:0 "[FROM.GetName] Established Buryat-Mongolian Autonomy"
transbaikalia.7.d:0 "The recent news from the wild Transbaikalia are the following. Ataman Semyenov has established the Buryat-Mongolian Autonomy in Verkhneudinsk and around it. Moreover, he has given legislative and executive power to the Burnatskom - a local Buryat-Mongol Council, which goes against our interests."
transbaikalia.7.a:0 "This will gain some sympathy towards our government."
transbaikalia.7.b:0 "Demand he reverts the autonomy."

transbaikalia.8.t:0 "[FROM.GetName] Demands We End the Buryat-Mongolian Autonomy"
transbaikalia.8.d:0 "Central Government in Vladivostok has demanded that we immediately revert the Buryat-Mongolian autonomy we have just established as this decision was made without permission of the Supreme Ruler."

transbaikalia.9.a:0 "Great."

transbaikalia.10.t:0 "[FROM.GetName] Keeps the Buryat-Mongolian Autonomy"
transbaikalia.10.d:0 "Despite our demands, Ataman Semyenov refused to end the autonomy for Buryat-Mongols. Although this would normally be regarded as a betrayal and refusal to follow the order of the Supreme Ruler, in the conditions of martial law in Transbaikalia, it seems that we have no choice but to accept the Buryat-Mongolian Autonomy as a fact."
transbaikalia.10.a:0 "This raises suspicions."

transbaikalia.11.t:0 "Buryat-Mongolian Cossack Host"
transbaikalia.11.d:0 "Ataman Semyenov decided to create a new Cossack Host in the Military District, consisting of Buryat-Mongols and controlled by the Transbaikal Cossacks. Such an initiative, according to the ataman, will contribute to the creation of a strong army, relying on horses, that have served the Buryat-Mongols faithfully for centuries."
transbaikalia.11.a:0 "Great!"

transbaikalia.12.t:0 "[FROM.GetName] Established Buryat-Mongolian Cossack Host"
transbaikalia.12.d:0 "The recent news from the wild Transbaikalia are the following. Ataman Semyenov has established the Buryat-Mongolian Cossack Host, under control of the Transbaikal Cossacks. Even if the establishment of the Cossack Host is a full right of Ataman Semyenov, it may go against our interests."
transbaikalia.12.a:0 "He can do it, we cannot resist it."
transbaikalia.12.b:0 "Demand he disbands the Host."

transbaikalia.13.t:0 "[FROM.GetName] Demands We Disband the Buryat-Mongolian Cossack Host"
transbaikalia.13.d:0 "Central Government in Vladivostok has demanded that we immediately disband the Buryat-Mongolian Cossack Host we have just established as this decision was made without permission of the Supreme Ruler."

transbaikalia.15.t:0 "[FROM.GetName] Keeps the Buryat-Mongolian Cossack Host"
transbaikalia.15.d:0 "Despite our demands, Ataman Semyenov refused to disband the Buryat-Mongolian Cossack Host. Although he has a full right to do it, it seems that we have no choice but to accept the Buryat-Mongolian Cossack Host as a fact."
transbaikalia.15.a:0 "This raises suspicions."

transbaikalia.16.t:0 "Sacred War Against Bolshevism"
transbaikalia.16.d:0 "Now that we have more or less strengthened the power in Transbaikalia, it is time to fight the main enemy. There is no one whom Ataman Semyonov would hate more than the Bolsheviks. Having been one of the first to declare war on Lenin, Semyenov has long established himself as a militant fighter against everything Bolshevik. In Transbaikalia, the so-called partisan army of the NRA is most active. Partisan cells are everywhere, irritating the people and enslaving their minds with fairy tales about communism. The most prominent of them are the so-called Atheists - near-proletkultist accomplices of Satan, destroying churches and killing priests, as well as disturbing peaceful Buddhists. It is necessary to destroy this Bolshevik scum as soon as possible!"
transbaikalia.16.a:0 "Catch these outlaws!"

transbaikalia.17.t:0 "Preparation of Manhunt Near Chita"
transbaikalia.17.d:0 "Yemelyan Yaroslavsky - the leader of the Union of Militant Atheists is none other than an ordinary fatman hiding under a false name and afraid to appear in the light, while crowds of his fanatics shed blood for false ideas. He is a coward and a traitor to the Motherland, who tries to decompose it at the expense of others. At the expense of people who could faithfully serve the Motherland. But we have some good news. Our informant reported about a meeting of the Union of Militant Atheists in Chita, where Yaroslavsky himself is rumored to be. It is necessary to carefully prepare an operation to eliminate this fat scum and destroy his best fighters. So this God-defying movement will fail.\n\nWe have several options for how to arrange a raid. The first is to blow up the building where the meeting will be held. Despite the fact that in this way we cannot avoid civilian victims, this guarantees us success in the fact that Yaroslavsky will not only be destroyed, he will honorably burn in hell for his sins. The second option is not to blow up the building, but to send a detachment of armed Cossack formations there, which will arrest the atheists, and they will be brought to an honest trial. The third option is to arrange an ambush, and wait until the atheists leave the meeting and then arrest them."
transbaikalia.17.a:0 "Blow up the building!"
transbaikalia.17.b:0 "Send Cossack Divisions."
transbaikalia.17.c:0 "Set up an ambush."

transbaikalia.18.t:0 "Manhunt Near Chita"
transbaikalia.18.d:0 "The demolition of the building turned into a complete disaster! It was successfully blown up, becoming a burial ground for several civilians, however, there was no meeting in the building. The informant who gave us the information turned out to be a traitor and set us up. While we were dealing with the blown-up house, we received information that militant atheists mobilized NRA partisans and captured some villages and towns in the Chita province. The partisans are approaching Chita, and we need to urgently organize a defense."
transbaikalia.18.a:0 "Protect the Chita approaches"
transbaikalia.18.b:0 "Defend the city center"

transbaikalia.19.t:0 "Manhunt Near Chita"
transbaikalia.19.d:0 "The Cossack divisions sent by us broke into the building, but did not find any traces of the presence of the atheists. It seems that we were tricked. Moreover, the informant turned out to be a traitor who distracted our attention. While we were focusing on the building, the Atheists mobilized partisan detachments and moved to Chita. We can only send the distracted divisions to the city center, where they will have time to meet with the NRA."
transbaikalia.19.a:0 "Send them to the city center!"

transbaikalia.20.t:0 "Manhunt Near Chita"
transbaikalia.20.d:0 "Our ambush revealed that no meeting was actually held in the building. The informant was exposed and we successfully learned about the impending coup. The partisan cells near Chita were quickly discovered and destroyed as a result of a short battle. Moreover, the informant-traitor told about the real shelter of Yaroslavsky, to which a Cossack patrol arrived in order to arrest the sinner. He really was there, and was caught red-handed. By order of Ataman Semyenov, he will be executed in the coming days."
transbaikalia.20.a:0 "Finally we will deal with them."

transbaikalia.21.t:0 "Defending Chita"
transbaikalia.21.d:0 "The Cossack troops defending the approaches to Chita managed to withstand the onslaught of the partisans and successfully destroyed them. The city was saved. The informant who betrayed us, under torture, confessed to where Yaroslavsky's real refuge is located. A Cossack patrol arrived there in order to arrest the sinner. He really was there, and was caught red-handed. By order of Ataman Semyenov, he will be executed in the coming days."
transbaikalia.21.a:0 "Finally we will deal with them."

transbaikalia.22.t:0 "'Chita Slaughter'"
transbaikalia.22.d:0 "The Cossack detachments did not manage to get into the center of Chita in time. Already on the approaches to the city, they were ambushed by partisans who struck from the rear and destroyed one of our best divisions. The city was left virtually unprotected, and soon partisan detachments captured it. The situation in the Military District has become like anarchy, and according to rumors, Ataman Semyenov is preparing for a retaliatory strike, mobilizing Buryat-Mongolian divisions and the best Cossacks in Verkhneudinsk. However, with Chita under the control of Atheists, to whom factory workers have openly begun to join, our chances of success are extremely small."
transbaikalia.22.a:0 "Wait for them in Verkhneudinsk."
transbaikalia.22.b:0 "Quickly mobilize and try to recapture Chita."

transbaikalia.23.t:0 "Transbaikal Civil War"
transbaikalia.23.d:0 "A civil war has almost begun in Transbaikalia. With Chita under the control of the Atheists and the NRA, Yemelyan Yaroslavsky himself came out of the shadows, declaring the victory of socialism in the Chita Labor Republic. Addressing the masses from the balcony of the Chita State Council, Yaroslavsky promised the citizens the immediate nationalization of resources and de-cossackization, as well as the liberation of the local population from the centuries-old slavery of capitalism. The industrial city, a major transport hub, was under the control of the partisans, and we were cut off from Vladivostok.\n\nHaving prepared the defense of Verkhneudinsk, Ataman Semyenov did not take into account only the fact that many Buryat-Mongols were completely unable to fight and were not ready for a civil war to break out in their region. Their political apathy led to the fact that many simply went home, not wanting to fight for the ataman, who had his own goals that did not meet the interests of the Buryat-Mongols.\n\nTogether with the NRA offensive on Verkhneudinsk, Ataman Semyenov was faced with a choice - to try to escape to wild Mongolia and stay there, surrendering Verkhneudinsk to the socialists, or to give the last fight. A fight that can be lost."
transbaikalia.23.a:0 "Escape. There's no way we can succeed."
transbaikalia.23.b:0 "We will never surrender to some zealots."

transbaikalia.24.t:0 "The Last Fight of Ataman Semyenov"
transbaikalia.24.d:0 "A civil war has almost begun in Transbaikalia. With Chita under the control of the Atheists and the NRA, Yemelyan Yaroslavsky himself came out of the shadows, declaring the victory of socialism in the Chita Labor Republic. Addressing the masses from the balcony of the Chita State Council, Yaroslavsky promised the citizens the immediate nationalization of resources and de-cossackization, as well as the liberation of the local population from the centuries-old slavery of capitalism. The industrial city, a major transport hub, was under the control of the partisans, and we were cut off from Vladivostok.\n\nIn an unsuccessful attempt to capture Chita back, Ataman Semyenov made the main mistake, relying on the forces of the Buryat-Mongols. Many refused to go into battle for the ataman and deserted, leaving the Cossacks alone with the red partisans.\n\nThe Cossack troops were defeated, and their leader, Ataman Semyenov, was captured and arrested by the partisans. A few hours later, he was taken to Chita under escort, where he finally saw his enemy in the face. Yaroslavsky, surrounded by armed partisans, ordered the hanging of the enemy of the socialists as a war criminal on the main Chita Square, taking revenge on him for the long-term oppression of the socialists in the Far East.\n\nWith the death of Semyenov, the last minutes of the life of the Military District came, which was now under the full control of the NRA and the Atheists."

transbaikalia.34.t:0 "The Burnatskom Problem"
transbaikalia.34.d:0 "Right now the Burnatskom, or the Central National Committee of the Buryat-Mongols of Eastern Siberia, is nothing more than an advisory body, that claims to be the supreme institution of the Buryat-Mongols. Though it does not have any power comparable to the Ataman's, its influence among local Buryat-Mongols is increasing. Probably, we have to make more loyal people in charge of Burnatskom, as now it mostly consists of Buryat-Mongolian Socialists-Revolutionaries and they are motives cannot be clear for us.\n\nIn this case, Semyenov has several choices. The first one is to leave Burnatskom as it is, hoping it won't do any trouble to us. The second option is to lobby the Burnatskom to make Tsogto Badmazhapov, a national-democrat, who is sympathetic towards Cossacks, its Chairman. The third option is the most radical one: get rid of SR-led Burnatskom and place a Cossack as its head. Though this will probably provoke some local unrest, we can be sure in its loyalty."
transbaikalia.34.a:0 "Leave it as it is."
transbaikalia.34.b:0 "Badmazhapov should lead the Burnatskom."

The Buryat-Mongols, outraged by the interference of the Cossacks in the affairs of their people, gathered in Verkhneudinsk to protest against the policy of Ataman Semyenov. The situation is tense to the limit and it seems that clashes between protesters and Cossacks are about to begin. We can either try to settle everything in peace, or we can brutally suppress the protest and show who is the boss here."

transbaikalia.35.b:0 "Suppress the unrest!"

transbaikalia.36.t:0 "Protesters Demand Resignation of the Burnatskom Chairman"
transbaikalia.36.d:0 "Quite obviously, the protesters have demanded the retirement of the Cossack Burnatskom Chairman and restoration of Mikhail Bogdanov, a Buryat-Mongolian SR as the leader of Burnatskom. Though giving up will grant some sympathy towards our government and perhaps the incident will be resolved, we can still try to ask for a compromissable candidate - Tsogto Badmazhapov, a national-democrat, benevolent towards Cossacks."
transbaikalia.36.a:0 "Give up. Restore Burnatskom as it was."
transbaikalia.36.b:0 "Suggest Badmazhapov as the new leader."

transbaikalia.38.a:0 "Give up. Restore Burnatskom as it was."
transbaikalia.38.b:0 "Why should we listen to them if they don't listen to us?"

transbaikalia.39.t:0 "The Unrest Ends"
transbaikalia.39.d:0 "With the Semyenov's offer to make Badmazhapov the new chairman as a compromissable candidate, the problem seems to be resolved. The new Burnatskom, led by Badmazhapov, though being more reactionary and authoritarian than the previous one is at least benevolent towards our rule."
transbaikalia.39.a:0 "At least the instability ended."

transbaikalia.40.t:0 "The Unrest Escalates"
transbaikalia.40.d:0 "With the unwillingness of either side to go to reconciliation, discontent turned into riots and armed clashes.

transbaikalia.42.d:0 "Our attempt to seize Verkhneudinsk has failed as many of the Buryat-Mongolian soldiers, previously alligned to us, has joined the side of their brethren. Tsogto Badmazhapov, the one who we trusted, has also declared his loyalty to the Buryat-Mongolian people and declared that he would fight for his homeland. With the proclamation of Free Buryat-Mongol State, the quickly mobilized divisions are trying to strike back and seize Chita, driving us away from the territory of the entire Transbaikalia."

Moreover, the Burnatskom had not arrested the Cossacks, but the new terms have been agreed on. The Military District has failed and now the banner with Soyombo is flying over Transbaikalia. With the Burnatskom rising to power, the Transbaikal Cossacks have been granted autonomy. In response, they should respect Buryat-Mongolian sovereignity and fight on our side."

It is brought to our attention that Ataman Semyenov is gathering his forces to march out of Transbaikalia and declare war on Kolchak. His plans include the creation of a full-fledged White Cossack state in the Russian Far East, the existence of which would be conditioned by Japanese patronage in exchange for simplified customs duties and gold. In return, the Japanese Empire undertakes to attack the Transamur in the event of the beginning of the offensive of the Transbaikal Cossacks."

Now, we can be sure of Japanese support, since a secret pact was signed in Tokyo a couple of days ago on a joint attack on Transamur."

transbaikalia.49.t:0 "[FROM.GetName] Refused to Sign the Pact"
transbaikalia.49.d:0 "The [FROM.GetAdjective] government has traitorously refused to sign the secret pact with us. It seems that they have made a bet on the government in Vladivostok, which means that they will not support us in our conquests."

transbaikalia.50.t:0 "Buryat-Mongolian Cossack Republic"
transbaikalia.50.d:0 "By the creation of the Buryat-Mongolian Cossack Republic, Semyenov means the endowment of its citizens with the rights and part of the duties of the Cossacks. Thus, the Buryat-Mongols will be able to use the traditional right of the Cossacks to own land. Forming the Buryat-Mongolian identity as a Cossack, Semyenov not only gives the Buryat-Mongols broad autonomy, but also offers them a successful option for implementing their national state. If the project is implemented, the Buryat-Mongols will most likely forever become part of a large Cossack family, but they will also receive their own developed armed forces and support from other atamans."
transbaikalia.50.a:0 "This is a stupid idea."
transbaikalia.50.b:0 "This what Buryat-Mongols need."


### Burnatskom Starting Events ###
burnatskom.1.t:0 "Burnatskom Consolidates Its Power"
burnatskom.1.d:0 "The Central National Committee of the Buryat-Mongols of Eastern Siberia, or shortly Burnatskom, has now consolidated its power in the Transbaikal region. With the power finally in their hands, it is time to solve some important issues and convene the national parliament to hold the first free elections in Buryat-Mongolian history."
burnatskom.1.a:0 "Let's start!"

burnatskom.2.t:0 "The Matter of Religion"
burnatskom.2.d:0 "Buryat-Mongolia is a country of Buddhists and Buddhism has been practiced here for centuries. However, Burnatskom needs to make an important decision on the state status of religion, since representatives of other faiths live on our territory. Our subsequent policy towards the non-Buddhist minority, as well as State policy in the field of education and, possibly, even international relations, will depend on this decision.\n\nThe 4 parties that are members of the Burnatskom have different ideas about the future of Buddhism in Buryat-Mongolia. Buddhist socialists believe that Buddhism should not be the state religion, but nevertheless, socialist and Buddhist principles can be counted together, given the religious history of the people. The Buryat-Mongolian social revolutionaries advocate the secularization of Buddhist society and a gradual departure from Buddhist dogmas as the basic rules and norms of society. The National Democrats are in favor of giving Buddhism the status of a state religion, since it is inextricably linked with the Buryat-Mongolian people. Radical Buddhists believe that Buddhism should not just be a state religion, but new laws and regulations should be based only on religious dogmas, and monasteries should have political power."
burnatskom.2.a:0 "Endorse Buddhist Socialism idea."
burnatskom.2.b:0 "Secularize Buryat-Mongolia."
burnatskom.2.c:0 "Buddhism is our state religion."
burnatskom.2.e:0 "Buddhism should have an overwhelming influence."

burnatskom.3.t:0 "The Cossack Issue"
burnatskom.3.d:0 "It so happened that Transbaikalia is a home not only for the Buryat-Mongols, but also for the local Cossack army, which has its own rights and duties, as well as privileges. Thanks to the ten-year dominance of the Transbaikal Cossacks of Semyenov on the territory of Transbaikalia, many associates of the creation of the Buryat-Mongolian Cossack army, as well as the "cossackization" of the local population, appeared among the Buryat-Mongols. Such people were called "kazakomans". Nevertheless, the question of the Cossacks remains open for Burnatskom.\n\nThe opinion of the parties on this issue is also divided. Buddhist socialists believe that the Cossacks should not have any privileges, and, moreover, there should be a raskazachivanie and the abolition of the Transbaikal Cossack Host. The social revolutionaries support them in this regard, since as a result of the socialization of the land, the Cossacks will lose their monopoly on land ownership. At the same time, they are ready to make concessions and save the Transbaikal Cossack army. The National Democrats advocate the preservation of the Cossack class and closer cooperation with them for the sake of common peace. Radical Buddhists believe that the Cossack class should be destroyed and expelled from the territory of Buryat-Mongolia."
burnatskom.3.a:0 "Full decossackization"
burnatskom.3.b:0 "Cossack should lose their priveleges."
burnatskom.3.c:0 "Cooperation with Cossacks."
burnatskom.3.e:0 "Expel the cossacks from Buryat-Mongolia."

burnatskom.4.t:0 "Russian Minority"
burnatskom.4.d:0 "The lands of Buryat-Mongolia are the homeland of not only the local population, but also a fairly large number, but nevertheless, a minority of the Russian population.\n\nBuddhist socialists advocate the preservation of the status quo, that is, the absence of any privileges of the Russian population. Socialists-revolutionaries believe that a small autonomy should be created for the Russian population, and the Russians themselves should have the same rights and obligations as the Buryat Mongols. The National Democrats are in favor of depriving Russians of any privileges, since they now live in a national republic. Radical Buddhists are quite keen on this issue, believing that any resident of Buryat-Mongolia is obliged to profess Buddhism, and in case of refusal, should be extradited from the territory of the state."
burnatskom.4.a:0 "Status-quo."
burnatskom.4.b:0 "Small autonomy for Russians."
burnatskom.4.c:0 "Deprive Russians from any privileges."
burnatskom.4.e:0 "They should profess Buddhism or be extradited."

burnatskom.5.t:0 "Status of Land"
burnatskom.5.d:0 "An important issue discussed in Burnatsky was also the issue of land. Buddhist socialists and social revolutionaries are convinced that the land should be socialized and belong to society for the self-organization of the Buryat-Mongolian peasants. The National Democrats believe that private property should be preserved on the land for the sake of the development of capitalism in the country. Radical Buddhists advocate the transfer of land to monastic parishes, which will have the power to distribute this land among the population or even have it in their property."
burnatskom.5.a:0 "Socialization of land"
burnatskom.5.b:0 "Private land ownership"
burnatskom.5.c:0 "The land should belong to local Monasteries"

burnatskom.6.t:0 "Reviving Burnarduma"
burnatskom.6.d:0 "During the short existence of Buryat-Mongolia during the civil war, the Buryat-Mongolian People's Duma, the parliament, was established by the Burnatskom of those times. After the liberation of Transbaikalia from the Bolsheviks, the Burnatskom also formally recognized the regime of Semyenov and in November 1918 the committee was transformed into the Buryat-Mongolian People's Duma. Thus, in 1918-19, Burnatsky's policy was to prevent attempts to interfere in the process of establishing national autonomy by both the Soviet government and the White Regime. On January 23, 1919, the Burnarduma issued a decree on the mobilization of Buryat-Mongols into the army, in the ranks of the Mongol-Buryat brigade 'Zrikto-Bator' as part of the troops of Ataman Semyenov, about 2000 people were subject to mobilization. However, in the autumn of 1919, the Burnarduma was actually defeated due to disagreement with the policy of Ataman Semyenov. Since then, the Burnarduma has ceased to exist, and now it is time to restore it as a full-fledged parliament of our state."

burnatskom.8.d:0 "Having been in the shadows for a long time, and doing mischief to the freedom-loving Buryat-Mongolian people, Militant Atheists led by Yemelyan Yaroslavsky came to light. Armed detachments, mainly consisting of NRA partisans, have captured several settlements near Verkhneudinsk today. Strongly opposed to the decision of the Burnatskom on the issue of religion, the SVB demands the immediate dispersal of the Committee, the establishment of the Transbaikal Soviet and transfer of the power to the workers and peasants. We need to fight back against the atheists before it's too late."

bry.1.d:0 "Now that the elections have been held, we will have to establish a new flag instead of the flag of Bogdo-Khan Mongolia, which has been used by the Burnatskom since the civil war to show the unity of our and the Mongolian peoples. We have three options: the first is a blue-white-yellow tricolor with a Buryat-Mongolian soyombo; the second is the same tricolor, but vertical; the third is a dark blue canvas with an enlarged soyombo in the center."

bry.11.a:0 "Embarassing."

bry.12.t:0 "Ties with Transbaikal Cossacks"
bry.12.d:0 "The Transbaikal Cossacks are actually our neighbors in the region. For a long time, the Buryat Mongols and the Cossacks lived together, but this cohabitation on the same territory was not always beneficial and friendly. Our new government believes that if there was a feud, then it needs to end. The Transbaikal Cossacks will receive autonomy and retain their privileges, but in return they will have to defend our interests and fight on a par with our army."
bry.12.a:0 "That will be good for all of us."

bry.13.t:0 "Evaluating Our Policy Towards Russia"
bry.13.d:0 "Since the end of the civil war, relations between our people and the Russians have been strange. Hoping to get at least some autonomy, for 5 years after the end of the civil war, Burnatskom remained a temporary authority under the leadership of Bogdanov, and the elections in the region were constantly delayed. In 1925, when these lands were again seized by Ataman Semyenov and were annexed to Transamur, hopes for autonomy dried up for good. Now that we are independent again, it is time to decide what to do with our Russian neighbors."
bry.13.a:0 "We should work towards becoming Russian autonomy"

Crushed soon after by the Transbaikal Cossacks, the movement of Balagats, however, never ceased to exist. Before his death, Lubsan-Sandan has given the young boy Dandaron, who was recognized as the rebirth of the hambo-lama Jayagsa-gegen, the abbot of the Kumbum complex in Tibet, the title of the King of the Teaching - Dharmaraja.\n\nSince then, the boy, and now the young adult, has been the indisputable leader of the Balagats, trying to promote his own views of radical Buddhism among the Buryat-Mongols.\nNow the time to proclaim the Kodunay Erkhidzh Balgasan - the theocratic state of Khodon has come."

bry.52.t:0 "Dealing With Banditry"
bry.52.d:0 "For several months, our country has been suffering from various criminals, river pirates and local corrupt officials who affect the stability of our state. With the establishment of the national police and active introduction into various criminal groups, we managed to achieve almost complete exposure and destruction of bandits. Of course, it will take more time to reduce the overall crime rate, but progress in this direction has already been made."

### Militant Atheists & NRA ###
atheists.1.t:0 "The SVB Consolidates Power!"
atheists.1.d:0 "Transbaikalia fell under the onslaught of the Union of Militant Atheists and the partisan army of the NRA. Long live socialism! Every day the resistance of the local population is fading, because it is useless. The power is in the hands of the Transbaikal Soviet of Workers and Peasants, and only it will create history from now on. It is time to start active actions to destroy religious fanaticism."
atheists.1.a:0 "We have things to do."

atheists.2.t:0 "Orthodox Church Banned"
atheists.2.d:0 "Finally, the most important of our decrees was implemented - a complete ban on the Orthodox Church. Religion is the opium of the people, which has poisoned so many lives, has thrown our country back several centuries in development. Religion is a regression, and from now on millions of beggars, whose lives have been ruined by faith, will not pray, but work for the good of the Motherland.\n\nAccording to the decree, the new ban applies to the entire territory of the former Russian Empire within the borders of 1914. Failure to comply with the decree will mean death for the churches and priests who disobeyed."
atheists.2.a:0 "Wake up, people!"

atheists.3.t:0 "The Great Destruction of Churches"
atheists.3.d:0 "A state campaign has already begun to destroy churches-previously shelters for the poor and a purse for fat priests. From now on, the poor will work and get paid, and not sit around praying for a good time.\n\nFrom now on, all Orthodox churches in Transbaikalia will be destroyed at the state level. The whole of Russia is next in line. Only by explosions will we achieve justice for all the humiliated."
atheists.3.a:0 "Burn in hell!"

atheists.4.t:0 "Mass Murders of Priests"
atheists.4.d:0 "Although Transbaikalia is not so rich in priests, they still exist, and before they have time to throw off their shoddy robes, they will be killed. By arming the working people with rifles, we will give them a goal - to kill every priest without trial. Until there is not a single priest left."
atheists.4.a:0 "Red Terror at its best."

atheists.5.t:0 "Forced Secularization"
atheists.5.d:0 "Transbaikalia is slowly being cleansed of the filth of religion. Buddhism and Orthodoxy have almost sunk into oblivion. Mass shootings of priests, the destruction of churches led to a total fear of the population before the Transbaikal Council. Now, instead of prayer services, people are working, because the liberation of our motherland is still ahead."
atheists.5.a:0 "Glory to Soviet!"
